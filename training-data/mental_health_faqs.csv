Q: Who is eligible for therapy at CMHS?,"A: All registered students at Storrs are eligible for services. Sometimes other persons important in your life, such a partner, spouse, or friend may be involved in the therapy process as well and do not have to be a UConn student. If it is an emergency, an appointment is not necessary and the student should come directly to CMHS or call 860-486-4705."
"Q: If I go to CMHS for help, does it mean there is something wrong with me?","A: No. Students who use CMHS are interested in their personal growth and adjustment in the world around them. Students face normal developmental concerns and academic pressures while UConn and may feel anxious, angry, lonely, or depressed. CMHS staff members are trained professionals and supervised graduate assistants who help students explore alternative coping strategies and ways of dealing with themselves and their environment."
Q: Isn’t it better for me to solve my own problems?,"A: A therapist doesn’t solve your problems for you. Rather, he or she helps you clarify issues so you can solve problems on your own with a therapist’s guidance, support, and expertise. The goal of therapy is to make you more self-sufficient, not more dependent."
Q: Will anyone be told I have come to CMHS?,"A: No. CMHS has a strict confidentiality policy and will not release information regarding contact with a student without permission from the student except in a few excepted areas. If a student is 18 years of age, it is the student’s right to choose whether to discuss their use of CMHS with parents, friends, academic advisors, or prospective employers."
Q: Why do people consider using therapy?,A: Therapy is a partnership between an individual and a professional who is trained to help people understand their feelings and assist them with changing their behavior. People often consider therapy under the following circumstances:
Q: What can I expect at my first visit to CMHS?,"A: Please arrive at least 20 minutes prior to the scheduled appointment to complete information forms. This will help the therapist know the reason(s) you are seeking services and how s/he can assist you. The therapist will meet with you for approximately 50 minutes. At this first session you will be asked questions to clarify your current situation and past history. The therapist will discuss treatment options with you. We will make every effort to see that you receive the best available care, whether it is on or off campus."
Q: What does research show about the effectiveness of therapy?,"A: According to a research summary from the Stanford University School of Medicine, therapy effectively decreased peoples’ depression and anxiety related symptoms–such as pain, fatigue, and nausea. Therapy has also been found to increase survival time after heart surgery, for people with cancer, and it can have positive effects on the body’s immune system. Research increasingly supports the idea that emotional and physical health are closely linked and that therapy can improve a person’s overall health status.
There is convincing evidence that most people who have at least several sessions of therapy are better off than untreated individuals, who are having emotional difficulties."
"Q: If I begin therapy, how should I try to gain the most from it?","A: There are many approaches to therapy and various formats in which it may occur–including individual, group, and couples. Despite the variations, all therapy is a two-way process that works especially well when you and your therapist communicate openly. Research shows that the outcome of therapy is improved when the therapist and the client agree early about what the major problems are and how therapy can help.
You and your therapist both have responsibilities in establishing and maintaining a good working relationship. Be clear with your therapist about your concerns that may arise. Therapy works best when you attend all scheduled sessions and give some forethought as to what you want to discuss during each session."
Q: How can I evaluate whether therapy is working?,"A: As you begin therapy, you should establish clear goals with your therapist. Perhaps you want to overcome feelings of hopelessness associated with feelings of depression. Or maybe you would like to control fear that disrupts your daily life. Keep in mind that certain tasks require more time to accomplish than others. You may need to adjust your goals depending on how long you plan to be in therapy.
After a few sessions, it is a good sign if you feel the experience is a joint effort and that you and your therapist enjoy a comfortable relationship. On the other hand, you should be open with your therapist if you find yourself feeling “stuck” or lacking direction once you have been in therapy awhile."
When should I seek help from a counselor?,"Answer: If you feel unhappy, depressed, anxious or angry and nothing you have been doing on your own seems to bring any relief. Sometimes, when a major transition occurs in our lives, we feel as if we're ""stuck"" and we may need the input of an objective professional to help clarify where we are in our journey. Perhaps a friend or relative has suggested that speaking to a counselor might be helpful. Often people believe there is something terribly wrong with them if they struggle with these feelings. Our society gives us greater permission to seek help when there is an obvious physical problem. At New Leaf Resources we encourage you to come in and see a Christian professional to check out these feelings. You may need just a session or two to get you back on the way to more serenity. If more counseling is necessary you will be able to work with a professionally trained person to help you in the process. Seeking help early often prevents more complex problems from developing."
What are some signs I might look for if I suspect a family member or friend might benefit from counseling?,"Answer: The answer to the first question gives insight here. If you notice a relative or friend is frequently unhappy, depressed, anxious, angry or seems stuck, that person might indeed benefit from counseling. You may notice someone retreating from family activities or suddenly striking out in anger or sleeping too much or sleeping very little. All of these may be signs that someone could benefit from counseling. Because there is so much shaming done by our society with regard to emotional or family problems, you need to be very careful about how you might suggest your friend or relative might benefit from counseling. Being truthful with what you have observed and displaying a sense of genuine care and empathy when you talk to this person is most helpful. When friends or relatives are experiencing these uncomfortable feelings, they often become defensive when seeking help is suggested. Be patient and kind whenever you are suggesting to anyone the possibility of seeking professional help."
"If I find myself thinking about suicide, what should I do?","Answer: If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, this should not be taken lightly. Talking to another person, preferably a professional is the first step in receiving help. Speaking to a doctor, counselor, pastor or close family friend may be the first place you turn. However, if you are having thoughts of harming yourself in the immediate or near future, please call the National Suicide Hot-line at 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433), call 911 or go the Emergency Room of the nearest hospital."
"What is the difference between a counselor/therapist, psychiatrist, and a psychologist?","Answer: There are several types of licensed therapists that provide professional counseling. In Illinois we have Licensed Clinical Professional Counselors (LCPC), Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT) and Licensed Clinical Psychologists. Indiana has the same general categories except Indiana has Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHC) instead of LCPCs. Some of these therapists also have special certifications in areas like addictions. Each of the professions listed above has different areas of training emphasis and expertise. At New Leaf we have all four categories of therapists/counselors on staff and they have a wide range of interest and expertise. If psychological testing is needed, that would be done by our psychologists. If medication is needed we would refer to a psychiatrist (a medical doctor specializing in mental health issues). Only medical doctors are allowed to prescribe medications. We have a consulting psychiatrist that we work with, but he is not part of the New Leaf staff. Generally the psychiatrist monitors a patient’s medication while the therapists, counselors and psychologists provide the counseling that is needed and they work together as a team. We believe that having all of these types of professionals working together creates a rich variety of skills to offer the clients we serve."
What are the counseling areas in which New Leaf Resources has expertise?,"Answer: Our staff has expertise in a broad spectrum of issues people may be facing. Here are some examples: Depression, Anxiety, Grief and Loss, Drug/Alcohol Addiction Assessment, Marital Problems, Family Relationship Problems, Abuse Recovery, Divorce Recovery, ADHD, Sexual Addiction, Adjustment Problems. Several of our staff members have special training and expertise to work with children. We have both art therapy and play therapy rooms available, to facilitate this specialty. We also have several therapists with past experience on the pastoral staff of various churches. This enables us to understand and help pastors and their families in their personal and professional lives. As a service to the church community, we offer support groups for pastors at no cost."
In what types of situations might New Leaf Resources not provide the best form of treatment?,"Answer: We provide counseling on an outpatient basis, usually one appointment each week. For situations where a person may be in need of more intensive services, New Leaf Resources staff would be happy to suggest several options of agencies that provide such care. Examples of this type of care would include intensive outpatient or day treatment (counseling several days per week), or inpatient treatment in a hospital setting, This may be due to the severity of the problem, as in the case of severe depression, or alcohol/drug dependence."
How can New Leaf Resources help my business?,Answer: Small and family-owned businesses often find themselves struggling with personality clashes and other personnel problems which have a negative effect. We promote better communication and improved interpersonal relationships to effect more wholesome work environments.
What makes New Leaf Resources different from other counseling centers?,"Answer: We are all licensed professionals. We believe that all people are created in God’s image and have immeasurable value, regardless of their life circumstances. A client assistance program is available for those who may not have sufficient financial resources. Our therapists are paid on salary, not based on how many clients they see, or on how much revenue is collected.
"
What makes you so special?,"Oh, we're just ordinary people who love what we do! You're really the focus here; we're just coming alongside you. And when that happens, you'll find us working hard, thinking about you in between sessions, prepping for sessions, remembering details about you, and laughing with you.
Office-wise, we're in an atypical therapy setting. We're in an office building with other small businesses, including start-ups, attorneys, and CPAs. That way, when you're waiting in the waiting area, you could be waiting for anybody. And, as much as we can help it, we also schedule sessions with time in between to give us time to regroup and reflect on your case. This also protects your confidentiality when you're not running into our other clients."
How long do I have to be in therapy?,"You don’t have to do anything! But if you want to make meaningful changes to your life and relationships, the length of treatment is based on your needs and what you want counseling to help with. We’ve had clients who have come for a few sessions, followed through with recommendations in between sessions, and felt better and moved on. We’ve also had clients come back into treatment as needed, or stay on to work on more complex issues. While it’s hard to predict how long therapy will take, we promise we won’t keep you for longer than needed."
Do you take insurance?,"Yes, we're an in-network provider with Premera, LifeWise, First Choice Health, and Kaiser Permanente. We're also a LyraHealth EAP provider. We bill these insurance companies directly for services provided. For other health plans not listed, we're considered an out-of-network provider. We'd be happy to provide you with a Superbill"" to submit to your insurance company for possible reimbursement."
Are there any benefits to not using insurance?,"You might elect to not use insurance for privacy reasons. Throughout treatment, your insurance company generally needs a mental health diagnosis to determine ""medical necessity"". When we run up against issues processing claims, insurance companies have required additional clinical information such as a treatment summary. Some of our clients have also expressed concerns about leaving a paper trail when applying for life, health or disability insurance."
Do you offer online therapy?,"Since the health crisis, we’ve made our online counseling program more robust. In addition to the flexibility of meeting online due to recovery from surgery or running late to an appointment, we’ve also made video sessions available to new and existing clients who want to meet remotely. This is only available to clients who are physically located in WA state and is not appropriate for clients traveling out-of-state or out-of-country. If using insurance, most in-state plans cover “telemedicine” as a part of your mental health/behavioral health benefit."
You’re all the way in Redmond. Shouldn’t I find someone closer?,"Traffic is a bear around here, especially if you’re coming from Seattle! We discourage carbon emission, but we do value a good fitting counselor-client relationship. We are people who are willing to drive all over the place to see our providers of choice. Different than say a dentist who works on your teeth once every six months, counseling usually means sharing a part of your life that you wouldn’t tell the average person. That said, it’s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist you choose and you believe that person has the skills to help you. If we're not your person after a few sessions, no problem, we’ll be happy to refer you to someone who might be a better fit.
Ready to make changes that will get you closer to the life you want?"

This includes content of sessions, records, scheduling of or attendance at appointments, and progress in counseling. There are some exceptions to confidentiality which students should know about before seeing a counselor. In situations in which a client may present a clear and imminent danger to themself and/or others, Student Counseling Center staff members are required to report this information to proper authorities for the protection of the student and the community. All Student Counseling Center records are kept separate from other University records. Written permission by clients is required to release counseling information. All counselors will discuss confidentiality when students are seen for the first appointment."
What if I don’t feel comfortable with the counselor who is assigned to work with me?,"There are times that for various reasons clients don’t feel comfortable with their counselors. The Student Counseling Center works to provide the best possible counseling services and recognizes that at times clients may want to request a different counselor. Clients may contact Dr. Laura Stallings, Director, at 503-352-2191 when such situations arise."
Is counseling only for people who have serious emotional problems?,"University and graduate/professional school work can be stressful at times. Many students encounter problems that are not easily resolved, or their usual ways of handling problems aren’t working well for some reason. Counseling can be a helpful means of support to address concerns that may be interfering with a student’s ability to function academically and/or socially."
What if I don’t want to see a counselor and just want some information about mental health issues or concerns students face?,"All students are welcome to visit the Student Health and Counseling Centers during business hours to pick up information focused on a variety of health and mental health topics. Also, the Student Counseling Center website provides links to online resources including self-help sites."
What is a Mental Health Counselor?,"According to New York State law, licensed mental health counselors (LMHC) “provide flexible, recovery-oriented therapy-combining traditional psychotherapy with a practical, problem-solving approach that creates a dynamic and efficient path for change and problem resolution.”
But we also do so much more! We provide services such as:"
Are LMHCs qualified to work with me?,"Yes, very much so! LMHCs hold a master’s or doctorate degree and have over 3,000 hours of post-masters supervised counseling experience. We complete national accreditation and state licensure exams that ensure all Licensed Mental Health Counselors meet uniform, ethical, and professional standards."
What is NYMHCA?,"NYMHCA is an acronym for the New York Mental Health Counselors Association, which is the professional organization representing Mental Health Counselors in New York State. NYMHCA is the state branch of the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA). Mental Health Counselors of Greater Rochester (the website you are on right now) is the local branch of NYMHCA for the Greater Rochester Area."
What do all these acronyms stand for?,"You may see a lot of acronyms and abbreviations floating around this website. Hopefully this will help:
LMHC – Licensed Mental Health Counselor LMFT- License Marriage and Family Therapist LCAT- License Creative Arts Therapist LP- Licensed Psychoanalyst MHCGR- Mental Health Counselors of Greater Rochester NYMHCA- New York Mental Health Counselors Association CASAC – Credentialed Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counselor MS – Masters of Science (graduate degree) NCC – National Certified Counselor"
"What’s the difference between Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Social Workers, and Mental Health Counselors?","LMHCs have many similarities and differences to other professions in our community. All of the professions perform similar functions in terms of performing psychotherapy. Psychiatrists can evaluate and treat mental health disorders and are licensed prescribers of psychiatric medications. Sometimes your primary care doctor can also act as a prescriber for certain mental health issues. Psychologists are doctoral-level practitioners who have a specific focus in evaluation, testing and measurement but who can also offer psychotherapy services. Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) are master’s level practitioners with clinical training and experience.
"
How long will therapy last?,"The length of therapy is quite variable, and the final decision regarding the length of therapy rests jointly with the patient and therapist. Some patients stay for as short a time as two or three sessions, while others are in therapy for two or three years or more as they continue to pursue goals and practice skills. Typically, the time in therapy is somewhere in between.
Regardless of the length of treatment, we strongly recommend that the final session be planned, so that the therapist and patient can summarize the work that has been done in therapy and say good-bye."" This resolution is associated with better long-term outcome for the patient than an abrupt termination."""
How long are the therapy sessions themselves? How often are they held?,"Typically, patients meet with therapists face to face for 45 to 55 minutes, depending on the situation. Patients also spend 5-10 minutes checking in and filling out short mood questionnaires (the BDI-II, BAI, and BHS). All told, on average, the patient spends about an hour at the Center for Cognitive Therapy each time they come for a session.
Most patients attend one session per week. Depending on the schedules of the patient and therapist, sessions can be held on the same day and time each week, or the session times may vary."
What are your hours? Can I have my appointments in the evening or the weekend?,"The initial intake evaluations are dedicated time slots in the morning and early afternoon on weekdays. Thus, your first appointment takes approximately 2 hours and generally requires you take off a morning or an afternoon from work or school. After that, most ongoing therapy sessions last between 50-55 minutes and occur between the hours of 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, though on some occasions it is possible to have an appointment before 9:00 AM or after 5:00 PM, depending on your particular therapist’s availability. Unfortunately, we do not have weekend hours.

What is an intake evaluation? How does this differ from the therapy sessions that I will be receiving afterward?,"The goal of the intake evaluation is to collect information to provide to the therapist in an efficient way. The interview is conducted by a clinician-in-training, who is supervised by a licensed clinician. Patients should expect to spend between two to three hours in the interview, with at least one break.
The benefits of this initial meeting include:"
How is a therapist chosen for me?,"The director, Cory F. Newman, PhD, in conjunction with the senior clinician who meets with the patient during the intake evaluation, decides which Center for Cognitive Therapy therapist will treat which patient. This decision is based partly on patient request (to see a female therapist, for example, or a therapist who specializes in a certain area). The decision is also based on the best match of the expertise of the therapist with the needs of the patient, and on practical concerns, such as scheduling issues. The therapists at the Center for Cognitive Therapy are well trained across a number of areas, and thus are able to see a wide range of patients.
Each therapist focuses on establishing a sense of mutual acceptance, respect, and teamwork with their patients. Our therapists are willing to work on any issues that may cause discomfort in the therapeutic relationship. If, as happens occasionally, a patient decides that he or she would prefer to work with a different therapist, Dr. Newman is available to discuss this matter, though it is our policy to require the patient and therapist to have at least one session to try to resolve the difficulty before transfers are made."
What are homework assignments and why are they a part of cognitive therapy?,"The most important, positive changes that you will make in your life will occur in your everyday experiences outside of your therapist's office. To help you make these real life"" changes, your therapist will help you design homework assignments. These assignments will show you how to apply the ideas and skills you've learned in therapy between sessions. This process will enable you to become your own therapist once your work with your cognitive therapist is complete."
Does cognitive therapy involve medications? Am I allowed to take medications if I'm in cognitive therapy? What if I need medications- can you arrange this for me? What if I prefer not to take medications at all?,"Many patients at the Center for Cognitive Therapy are on medications, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, etc. In fact, some research suggests that a combination of cognitive therapy and the proper medications can be very useful. If you wish to start medications along with cognitive therapy, we can help arrange a medical evaluation at the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Psychiatry.
In most cases, if you do not wish to take medications, you will receive cognitive therapy alone. If you and your therapist believe it is warranted, you can discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of adding medication to the treatment plan. In some cases, we may require that a patient be well maintained on medication before we begin therapy."
Do you provide couples counseling or family therapy?,"We do not currently offer couples counseling or family therapy. In some cases, individual patients may choose to invite a partner or family member to attend one to three sessions of their individual treatment, to provide information to benefit the individual patient’s care.

Do you offer group therapy?,"Please click here to view information regarding group therapy opportunities.

Do you provide therapy for children and adolescents?,"Although most of our patients are over the age of 18, the Center occasionally treats older adolescents on a case-by-case basis. All parties agree on what information will be shared with the parent(s) and what information will be confidential. Most often, however, we will make a referral to a therapist who specializes in treating children or adolescents.
Back to Top"
What if I want to get therapeutic help for someone else?,"Sometimes people call us to seek treatment for a friend or relative. If you are calling to try to arrange a course of therapy for someone over the age of 18, we will be happy to listen to your concerns, but you will not be able to make an appointment for anyone other than yourself. The patient himself or herself must call to be scheduled for an appointment. Once the appointment is scheduled, we cannot share any further information with you, due to confidentiality concerns, unless the patient gives written permission.
If you are concerned or frustrated because you wish to arrange an appointment for a person who does not wish to come in for treatment, we sympathize with your predicament, but your options are limited. First, you may choose to arrange a one-time consultative appointment"" for yourself. This is a 50-minute session with a therapist who will attempt to answer your questions about how you might deal more effectively with the individual. Second, you may choose to begin therapy yourself, especially if your life has been adversely affected by the other person, and you are looking for ways to change your situation. Third, you may try to gain the individual's cooperation in entering therapy by offering to go into therapy together."""
Can I receive cognitive therapy even while I am receiving additional treatment elsewhere?,"In most instances, we do not recommend being involved in two or more ongoing courses of individual therapy. Unless the various therapists share the same orientation to therapy, there is the risk that the patient will receive conflicting advice, which may impede the patient's progress. The old saying that too many cooks can spoil the broth"" is applicable here. It is important that the patient receive consistent feedback and direction in order to get the most out of therapy. In addition, having more than one therapist can work against the ultimate goal of having the patient learn to depend on himself or herself. Cognitive therapy works well, in part, because we teach people the skills that they need to have faith in themselves. Having multiple therapists may slow down the process of achieving this sense of heightened self-sufficiency."
Does insurance cover my treatment?,"The Center for Cognitive Therapy is out of network with most insurance carriers. With the exception of HUP employees and some Penn employees and Penn students, obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies is the responsibility of the patient. Payment in full is expected at time of service. You will be given a receipt which has all the information usually required by insurance companies to be reimbursed. If you have questions about seeking reimbursement, it is wise to call your insurance company with specific questions about your coverage.
For Penn employees and their families who are covered under Penn's Penn Care plan, there is a $20 co-pay per visit for services at CCT. For Penn employees and their families who are covered under Penn’s Aetna POS II plan, there is a $30 co-pay per visit for services at CCT. Authorization/referrals are not required and there are no visit limits for any of these plans. For Penn students who are covered solely under the Penn student plan (Aetna), there is a $10 co-pay per visit. No referral is required and there is a 50 visits limit per plan year. All of the above-mentioned co-pays apply to both the initial diagnostic evaluation and the regular therapy sessions alike. If you are covered by the Penn student plan (Aetna) but you also have another insurance (e.g., your parent's plan), you will have to pay the full cost of your appointment, then submit for out-of-network reimbursement from your parent's plan, then submit whatever isn't covered to the Penn student plan (Aetna)."
What if I have a legal problem at the time I am seeking therapy?,"Generally speaking, we recommend that you seek the services of a forensic psychologist or psychiatrist if you are involved in a legal matter that may require the involvement of your therapist or clinical records. We will be happy to schedule you for an evaluation here at the Center for Cognitive Therapy once your legal matter is resolved. We can also give you a referral to a forensic psychiatrist affiliated with Penn.

Can you help me with my psychiatric disability claims?,"We do not do evaluations for disability, and our approach is to enable patients to improve their functioning so that they are able to go to (or return to) school or work."
How many credits are required?,The program requires a minimum of 91 quarter credits (comprehensive option) or 97 quarter credits (thesis option) to be completed in two years of full-time graduate study. The degree is a Master of Science (M.S.) in Clinical Mental Health Counseling.
Does the program require a thesis?,"A thesis is not required. Students may complete a thesis, or pass a written comprehensive examination, or do both if they so desire.
Can I attend part-time or take classes in the summer or evening?"
Do you have a satellite program?,"The program is offered on the campus in Bellingham only. Some second-year students have completed internships as far away as Seattle or Vancouver, B.C., but they still must take courses on campus."
How large is the program?,We accept six students per year. The program is intentionally small in order to maintain small student/faculty ratios and class sizes.
Can I be certified/credentialed/licensed in other states?,"Every state has its own requirements for certification, credentialing, or licensing (Washington State has a licensing process). You will need to contact the State Department of Licensing for specific information about each state. In general, people licensed in one state by a CACREP-accredited program can become licensed in other states."
What is the Licensing Process in Washington State?,"Upon completion of a counseling program, one needs to complete 3 years or 3000 hours of postgraduate full-time counseling, complete 100 hours of supervision, and pass a national licensing exam. Because we are a CACREP accredited program, graduates from our program are granted credit for 50 hours of supervision and 500 hours of postgraduate work experience and may take the licensing exam (NCE or NCMHCE) during their second year in the program."
When should I start my application?,Complete applications are due February 1 of each year.
"Should my references be faculty members or work supervisors, or does it matter?",It is advisable to have a mix of recommendations. Identify at least one faculty member who can address your ability to complete graduate level work. It is also advisable to select a reference who can discuss your potential as a counselor.
May I include extra information in my application?,It is a good idea to include a cover letter that describes your interest in becoming a counselor. Be sure to let us know about your related work experience.
I've heard it is really hard to get admitted. How do I know if I stand a chance?,"Our program is small and we receive many strong applications. However, this should not necessarily discourage you. If you believe that you have special qualities that we should consider, be sure to let us know. We do consider grades and test scores, but we consider other things as well."
1. How do I get an appointment at the Counseling Center?,"Baylor University Counseling Center welcomes students on a first-come, first-serve basis in our Walk-In Clinic. The clinic is open Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students arriving after 3:30 p.m. may be seen the following day, unless they are in crisis. The Walk-In Clinic operates similarly to an urgent care clinic where patients are seen in the order in which they check in. If a students cannot wait due to class, schedule conflicts or unforeseen circumstances, they can return the following morning to be seen."
2. Do I have to wait at the walk-in clinic or can I make an appointment for an initial assessment?,"The Walk-In Clinic system is designed to meet the needs of Baylor students in a timely fashion. In order to enter the BUCC system you must first have an initial assessment through the Walk-In Clinic system. Students are asked to wait until the first available counselor can see them. Initial assessments cannot be scheduled ahead of time, however the initial assessment typically occurs only once per academic year. If you are referred for counseling at BUCC you will be able to schedule subsequent appointments."

What is the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?,"and both provide treatment to individuals with emotional problems. Psychology is both a profession and an independent scientific discipline. Psychiatry is a specialization within the field of medicine. Typically, a psychologist will have a Master or Doctorate degree and a psychiatrist will have a Medical degree. Psychologists help people control and change their behavior as a primary method of treating problems. Psychiatrists prescribe medication as a primary means of changing people’s behavior. Both psychologists and psychiatrists assume that complex emotional problems are likely to be the result of both biological and psychological causes."
Are you a Psychologist or a Psychiatrist?,
How do I go about finding a competent psychologist?,"While selecting a psychologist is similar to selecting any other professional, the relationship you will have with the psychologist is very personal. I advise you to check the psychologist's credentials, including both training and experience. Make sure to talk to the psychologist directly before making an appointment. Ask questions about the services that will be provided, so you will not get something different from what you expected. See how comfortable you feel when you are talking with the psychologist. Finally, contact the state and national psychological associations to make sure the person is in good standing. Please visit the link ."

How are counseling and psychotherapy different?,"Rather than being concerned about the label, ask yourself if you have a problem that you are not able to deal with effectively. A psychologist can help you identify the thoughts, feelings and behaviors that are creating problems in your life and can help you resolve these problems."
How often are therapy appointments scheduled?,
How many treatment sessions will be needed?,

However, there are generally recognized exception to this confidentiality protection. Psychologists have a ""duty to warn"" if they learn that a client plans to harm themselves or another person, and psychologists are also legally obligated to report child abuse. It is important to note that if you request insurance reimbursement for psychological services (or any other health service) confidential information is communicated to the company to process the claim and manage your account."

What is Christian Counseling?,"Christian Counseling is clinical psychotherapy that allows you to utilize your faith and the power of Jesus Christ to address mental health issues. Christian Counseling assumes that psychology is not the cure for our issues, but is useful in assessing, understanding, and coping with them. According to John 8:32, it is the truth of God that sets us free from our struggles, and in John 14:26 we find that the Holy Spirit is our true Counselor."
What are your hours?,"Generally, Renewal Center is open Monday – Thursday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, and Friday 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM. Additional times are available by request and wait lists for evening hours are often necessary as the demand for these times often outweighs our availability."
What different kinds of counseling do you offer at Renewal?,"As mentioned in the services section, any one type of treatment intervention does not fit everyone nor does it fit all disorders. Your intervention needs to fit your needs and your symptoms! We will help you determine the modality of treatment that will fit you best. Modalities of treatment include types of counseling such as family counseling, group counseling and individual counseling. Types of treatment interventions can vary greatly, and you and your counselor will define your treatment plan together and will include different types of counseling such as Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions, Insight Therapy, Rational Emotive Therapy, Supportive Therapy and many other counseling techniques that are cutting edge in the field."
Do you have Psychiatrists?,"Yes, Renewal Center utilizes a multi-disciplinary approach to counseling using teams of professionals coordinating your care together. Our psychiatrists at Renewal Center operate as the facilitators of your care, giving feedback and direction to your diagnosis, your treatment goals and any medical care that is needed to assist in decreasing your symptoms. Our Medical director is Dr. Robert Bauer, who has helped us develop programming at Renewal Center for over four years now. Our psychiatrists are available to you for consultation, as we believe that having a team of professionals working for you all under one roof will best facilitate your recovery."
Why do I have to see a counselor to see a psychiatrist?,"Treatment is most effective for those who need medications when they are being seen by a psychiatrist and a counselor who are working together as a team. Unfortunately, our doctors at Renewal are often overbooked, and thus we are only able to offer psychiatric services to those who are active in counseling (at least one session per month) at Renewal Center. We apologize for any convenience that this may cause and we are able to make referrals to those looking to see a psychiatrist only for their treatment."
How do you pick my counselor?,Finding the right counselor for you is a matter of considering many factors including:
Are all of your counselors Christian?,"Yes! Our niche at Renewal Center is in having therapists that are available and equipped to help you incorporate your Christian faith into your therapy process if you so choose. All of our clinicians have professed a faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior, but they also have all professed a deep level of acceptance and care for all others that have differing beliefs. We work with all faiths, denominations, and religions at Renewal Center, and have had nothing but positive feedback at how accepted and cared for our clients have felt no matter their beliefs."
How long will my appointment last?,"Per our insurance carriers, a psychotherapy session is defined as a 45 to 50 minute time slot focused on Mental Health goals. Our group therapy sessions range from an hour to an hour and a half, and our medication reviews are generally 15-20 minutes."
When am I expected to pay?,"Payment is expected at time of service. At times it is difficult to determine the exact amount of your insurance co-pay, and a balance will be allowed accrue with a signed agreement. All balances are billed monthly and are due within 30 days of receipt of your bill."
What kind of insurances do you take?,"Renewal Center has worked hard to panel with every insurance carrier that you may be a part of. In order to do so, Renewal Center first had to be approved by a national accreditation service called CARF (Council of Accreditation for Rehabilitation Facilities), which most insurance carriers require in order to demonstrate that our practices meet high quality standards. Upon passing CARF with flying colors, Renewal Center was then able to contract with Blue Cross as a OPC (Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic) and with most of the other popular third party payers. We have more insurance payer options than most of our competitors because we have a variety of state and federal third party payer contracts including Medicaid HMOs, Medicare and local Community Mental Health agencies. There are very few insurances that we are not able to accept – please refer to the Fees and Services section for a semi-complete listing."
How much will I have to pay?,"Renewal Center has a sliding fee scale for those who either do not have insurance or choose to not use their insurance for payment at Renewal. This sliding fee scale adjusts your rate to give a discount to those who meet certain minimum annual income requirements. Though there are some exceptions to even this, rates for most will start at $75 per session. Please refer to our Fee Schedule for specifics. For all others utilizing your insurance provider for payments, co-pays and co-insurances should be listed on your contract or available by calling your insurance carrier. Our office staff would be glad to assist you in this process."
Do you see kids?,We love kids at Renewal Center and have gone to great lengths to provide for the mental health needs of the children represented in our communities! Please refer to Play Therapy to learn about our clinical counseling services and AD(H)D Assessments to learn about assessing your child’s needs and using our child psychiatrists to help your child medically.
What if I don’t have insurance?,"Please call our office and ask if there are options to assist you in obtaining the treatment that you need and deserve. For those without financial resources and for those without insurance, we often have available times with our interns at much reduced fees. Each counselor at Renewal has a certain number of “pro bono” hours that they give, and if these are not available, often a person’s church or community can be engaged to help with payments. Please refer to our links for your local Community Mental Health hotlines and call for additional help; these centers are mandated to assist with mental health needs of those without resources, and they have public funding for those who are in crisis."
What methods of payment do you accept at Renewal Center?,"We accept cash, checks, and most major credit cards as payment at Renewal Center. Payment is required at the time of service and all balances are due at the end of the month in order to continue scheduling with your counselor."
Do you offer substance abuse counseling?,"Yes! Renewal Center is registered and approved by the State of Michigan as a Licensed Substance Abuse Facility. Many of our clinical staff have specific training and expertise in addictions and have credentials in the state of Michigan as a Certified Advanced Addictions Counselor. For further questions about programming, please feel free to call and ask for our Substance Abuse Program Director."
How do I set up an appointment?,"We would be glad to call you and help you begin the process – just visit the Contact Us section and fill in your information and our office staff will be sure to call you and set up your first appointment. You may also call us in Mount Clemens at 586-783-2950, Port Huron at 810-966-0099, or Midland at 989-244-1888 and our support staff will take your demographics, your presenting problem and your insurance information and set you up for an assessment session with the counselor that best meets your needs."
Will my information by kept private?,"Yes! There are laws (HIPPA) in our country that require your counselor to keep all information confidential that you share in your sessions. Privacy is a core value for Renewal counselors, and they have a moral and ethical standard to protect your private health information. There are only a few exceptions to your rights of privacy that largely center around the need to share information to protect your safety, the safety of others, a court subpoena or a signed release by you to give out such information."
What is CARF?,"CARF is the Council for Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities and is responsible for auditing all operations of the organizations that contract with it to ensure they are meeting the highest quality standards in the mental health field. CARF audits Renewal Center at least every three years and has given the highest marks of excellence for our practices clinically, financially, ethically and medically. For more information, please visit www.carf.org."
Do I have to talk about “Christian” stuff during counseling?,"No. Renewal Center utilizes what is called Person Centered Planning, which means that you are in control of what you talk about in your sessions. The staff of Renewal Center are dedicated to meeting you right where you are at; they are invested in helping you to utilize your beliefs (not theirs!) in your counseling experience no matter what faith or practices that may include. Renewal Center has been known to work with persons from all walks of life and many who profess beliefs opposing traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs."
How will my faith be incorporated into my sessions?,"True Christian counseling seeks to give input that is not based on the opinion of the counselor but on the foundation of principles and discernments that come from above. Your faith will be incorporated on many levels and especially into your decision making process, into the process of reality testing your thoughts (which lead to your emotions and behaviors), and as a source of strength and encouragement for the healing journey you are walking."

What are Some Challenges of Telemental Health?,"While there are many benefits to telemental health, there are challenges:"
Do You Need to Be in the Same State as Your Online Therapist?,"Licensing laws differ between states and within states. Therefore, receiving telehealth from a therapist in another state may not be possible. Some states have licenses that permit out-of-state clinicians to provide therapy for 10 to 30 days.
Fortunately, therapists can treat clients in the states in which they are licensed. This means that people can still receive quality care from a therapist who may work in another county or across the state. This is especially beneficial for those who may live in rural areas."
Is Online Therapy Effective?,"Telemental health is an effective form of care for clients and clinicians. In fact, it may help reduce the stigma around mental health treatment. Those who are hesitant to visit a therapist in a clinical setting can still receive quality care in the comfort of their home. Teletherapy can bridge the gap for quality mental health treatment.
We remain committed to providing quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet the needs of current and prospective clients, The Light Program is offering telehealth for outpatient services, including psychiatry. We use BlueJeans, a HIPAA-compliant platform, to conduct our telehealth sessions."

If a counseling training program is accredited by CACREP, students are assured that the program’s content, quality, and standards of training meet the highest level of standards in the profession."
5. How does accreditation impact my licensure should I decide to find work in another state?,"Accreditation could impact your ability to be licensed in other states in the near future. There are many states who have or are considering making graduation from a CACREP program a requirement for licensure. While this won’t go into effect for several years (Most give 6‐7 years for programs to be accredited before the mandate goes into effect), it could affect your ability to be licensed in other states in the future."

10. What is a Hybrid course?,"When a course is referred to as a “hybrid” course, this means that the majority of the course content is delivered by technological means (i.e. Blackboard).

5. Can I count my job as my Internship?,Your job can count as your internship provided your job can provide you with the types of counseling activities required for your internship.
6. Can I take all six hours of Internship in the same semester?,"It is not recommended that you take all 600 internship hours in one semester, but it is possible to do so if you are able to put in the time. What you may gain is completion of your degree sooner and the ability to get out in the field and start working (which no one would blame you for)."
1. Where do I find the library databases?,The Library databases are found in the Marshall Library Website: Here’s a direct link to the databases:
WHAT IS COUNSELING?,"Counseling is the process of speaking with a mental health professional about your problems or concerns. The mental health professional listens with an objective ear and helps you learn more about yourself, and new ways of looking at situations. This process can help you feel more capable of identifying and solving problems on your own. The primary goal is to help you develop the skills and abilities to solve problems as they arise, in order to make the most of your academic experience."
When should I contact The Counseling Center?,"Many students decide to pursue counseling. It does not mean you aren’t “normal.” It is not a sign of weakness but of strength – if you initiate counseling, it is evidence that you are taking charge of your own wellbeing. Many students have found Counseling to be helpful when they are having trouble functioning here at Pratt. Some common reasons for seeing a staff therapist include relationship problems, depression, anxiety, academic worries, and family difficulties.
You may benefit from two or three sessions to address a specific area of concern, or you may find it helpful to use more sessions to address concerns that warrant more attention. Our services are focused on short-term counseling but referrals are often made for students who wish to consider longer-term counseling or psychotherapy."
WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT FROM MY COUNSELOR?,"Your counselor is a licensed mental health professional (clinical social worker, psychologist) who has been trained to help you identify and begin to resolve the issues and problems that are of concern to you. It is perfectly common and understandable to have some anxiety about seeing a counselor - your counselor will establish a safe and structured environment in which you can feel comfortable discussing your thoughts and feelings. The approach is non-judgmental and collaborative. Counselors help clarify options, provide support and understanding, assist with setting goals, explore feelings and correct misconceptions."
WHAT IF I TRIED COUNSELING BEFORE AND I DIDN'T HAVE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE?,"Sometimes your initial experience with counseling doesn't go as you thought or hoped it would, which can be disappointing or discouraging. There are multiple reasons this might be the case: talking about painful thoughts and feelings can be difficult; counseling may not offer the immediate relief you expected; and sometimes it takes more time to better understand and work on your difficulties.
The Counseling Center is happy to talk to you about your experience and welcomes your feedback, so if you feel that a previous experience with counseling/therapy was dissatisfactory, we encourage you to let us know and give counseling another try by reaching out to us at therapy@pratt.edu."
WHEN IS PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION USEFUL?,"Medication for mental disorders can be helpful when a student's mood or thoughts seem to be getting in the way of work or the ability to sustain a meaningful social life. Although many students are opposed to taking medication, there are conditions that can be significantly improved through its use. Psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse-practitioners are specially trained to perform medication evaluations so we highly recommend utilizing their expertise. If you are in need of medication for the first time or require a reevaluation of current medications, then we can provide referrals to a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse-practitioner. If you have been doing well on a prescription from your hometown psychiatrist and need a new one while you are at Pratt, one of the prescribing providers can help with new prescriptions for a previous medication. Please have a copy of your medical records including information related to your prescription in your Pratt medical file."
WHAT IF MY PROBLEM IS WITH ALCOHOL OR ILLEGAL DRUGS?,"All conversations that occur between and your therapist in the Counseling Center are confidential and private. By law, your privacy is protected. If you are having difficulty with your use of alcohol or drugs, you can speak safely with one of us. The information will not go on your academic record, and we do not share information with other departments in the school. We can help you explore your use in a non-confrontational and non-judgemental manner, and you decide what you would like to do next. We have many options for students who are struggling with alcohol or drug misuse (including our Clean Cats College Recovery Program). We can also make referrals to therapy, treatment locations and provide support to the student who is struggling."
WHAT IF I JUST CAN'T FUNCTION AT ALL THIS SEMESTER?,"Occasionally, psychological problems prevent a student from being able to complete a semester's work. A serious depressive episode is a common reason to temporarily suspend study. In this situation, the counseling office can help the student arrange a medical leave until the student is ready and able to continue at Pratt."
WHAT IS A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY AND WHAT DO I DO?,"A psychiatric emergency occurs when someone's mental health condition deteriorates to the point that they are unable to function and/or is a threat to their safety or the safety of others. This decline may be caused by a reaction to overwhelmingly bad news, a drug or alcohol overdose, a medication problem, or an acute mental condition. This may happen when someone threatens to commit suicide, or does not seem to be fully in control of their mental faculties.
In the case of a psychiatric emergency, you should contact The Counseling Center at 718.687.5356 for assistance. We also have after-hours contact available by calling our main number. In the event of an emergency, please call 911 or Campus Security at 718.636.3540. If you are a student living in an on-campus residence hall, the RA or RD on duty may also provide assistance during a psychiatric emergency."
HOW DO I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?,You can call to make an appointment at 718.687.5356 or you can come to The Counseling Center in the ICS Building to schedule an appointment with the Admin.
What does a therapy session look like?,"Therapy sessions are 50 minutes long for individual, couples, and family counseling. Longer sessions are available, but pricing and availability are personalized to each therapist. After you have booked your first appointment, you will be sent paperwork through your portal to complete before your first session. This way you can complete the paperwork and not eat away at your session time. For couples or marriage therapy, there will be a Couples Questionnaire for you both to fill out separately via your portal. Your first session will look a little different than the rest. During your first session your therapist will get you acclimated to therapy – going over confidentiality, limitations, and what a typical session with them looks like. This is a great time to ask any questions you have. You will have time to discuss the frequency of your therapy sessions – once a week is standard.
Our therapist Jacob Munhoz, AMFT #109499 (supervised by Elizabeth Perkins, MFT 53764), talks about what a therapy session with him is like:"
How much does therapy cost?,"Estes Therapy has multiple therapists available to best meet your needs – including your financial ability. However, the cost of therapy goes beyond the amount of money you are spending. With therapy you are getting the tools and learning the skills you need to feel successful in yourself and your relationships. You are investing in yourself and your relationship; this will end up saving you money and heartache down the road. Each therapist has their fee on their information page (Meet the Team here). Licensed therapists will be the most for a session, Associate Marriage and Family Therapists will be a step cheaper, and our Clinical Mental Health Counseling Trainee was hired as the cheapest option in response to COVID and it’s financial toll on the San Diego community. There are a limited number of sliding scale and low fee slots, you can call to ask about these.
You can find more about what being an Associate MFT means here."
Who do you work with?,"With a team of therapists working for Estes Therapy, I have no doubt you’ll be able to find a therapist who meets your needs. You can learn more about each therapist on their information page here. We have therapists who works with children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Our therapists provide individual therapy, couples and marriage therapy (including premarital counseling), and family therapy.
We also offer therapy sessions in Spanish with Rina (for children, individuals, and couples). I encourage you to explore each therapist’s page to get an idea of their topics of focus. Estes Therapy works with all kinds of issues – whether you are looking for guidance, working through trauma, working on repairing a relationship, or seeking help with self exploration."
How do I find a therapist in San Diego?,"Therapy, whether you are looking for an individual therapist or couples counseling, is not one size fits all. Just because a therapist isn’t the right fit does not mean therapy is not a good fit. I know it can be discouraging if you don’t feel like your therapist is a good fit, so I strongly encourage you to do some research beforehand. Think about what you are looking for – what are your therapy goals? Personal growth? Facing anxiety? Recovery from an eating disorder or improved body image? Grief counseling? Premarital counseling? Co-parenting? Improved communication? Familiarize yourself with some theoretical orientations to get an idea of what would work for you. For example if you are seeking therapy to work through trauma, an EMDR therapist might be right for you.
We are so lucky to have so much information at our fingertips thanks to the internet. Check out the websites of potential therapists and anywhere else they might appear (newspapers, magazines, news segments, podcasts). It is important to remember therapy brings up emotions and can be uncomfortable. Look past your own anxiety and be open minded to what the therapist has to offer. Sometimes going in to counseling requires you to do some soul searching and take responsibility for your actions. I recommend giving it 5 sessions to see if your therapist is a good fit (at the minimum 3!). This gives you time to get comfortable, get into the issues you want to address, and differentiate between feelings towards the topics and therapy from your feelings towards your therapist."
Where are you located?,"We currently have two offices, one in Mission Valley and one in Oceanside. We also offer online therapy sessions through COVID and beyond."
Can I walk in to UChicago Student Wellness to seek treatment?,"We encourage all students to call for an appointment. Students who walk in seeking care will be seen by a nurse who will triage their symptoms and schedule a same-day or future appointment, or provide them with home care instructions. Appointments are prioritized based on urgency."
What is the role of UChicago Student Wellness in providing mental health services?,"UChicago Student Wellness provides mental health care to University of Chicago students. This care includes needs assessment, psychotherapy, psychiatric consultation, the Academic Skills Assessment Program, support groups, referrals, emergency services, and health promotion and wellness programs."
Who are the counseling and psychiatry providers at UChicago Student Wellness?,"UChicago Student Wellness employs a multidisciplinary and diverse staff of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, an advanced practice psychiatric nurse, clinical social workers, as well as administrators. UChicago Student Wellness clinicians share a dedication to providing culturally informed mental health services. UChicago Student Wellness providers have expertise in a wide range of specialty areas, including: alcohol and other drug use/misuse, eating concerns, LGBTQ mental health, and academic skills support services. Unlike most university counseling centers, UChicago Student Wellness has a psychiatric team that provides psychiatric evaluations and ongoing medication management."
How long does it take to get a counseling or psychiatry appointment at UChicago Student Wellness?,"Students who are experiencing a mental health crisis can walk in to the counseling and psychiatry office during operating hours (8:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Monday–Friday) and meet with a crisis intervention counselor (and, if clinically indicated, with a psychiatric provider), without an appointment."
"If a student is having a mental health crisis, can they get help at UChicago Student Wellness?","Yes. Students who need to meet with a therapist urgently are encouraged to walk in during UChicago Student Wellness operating hours to meet with the crisis intervention counselor (and, if necessary, with someone from the psychiatric team). After hours and on weekends, year-round, students have telephonic access to a Therapist-on-Call (773.702.3625). More information can be found on the"
Where can I go to fill or refill a prescription?,"Students can fill or refill prescriptions at DCAM Pharmacy located in the University’s medical center (). Students also have access to local pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens. Please see our page for more information."
In what kinds of situations does UChicago Student Wellness refer students to outside providers? Why is that necessary?,"UChicago Student Wellness is committed to making the best use of available resources, and to serve the entire student community quickly and without a waitlist. The demand for these services is extensive and requires substantial resources. UChicago Student Wellness focuses on providing timely access to therapy, and does not provide open-ended, long-term individual or couples therapy."
Does UChicago Student Wellness help students find outside providers?,"Yes. When a UChicago Student Wellness therapist recommends treatment by an outside provider, the UChicago Student Wellness therapist will work with a student to identify possible providers and, as appropriate, facilitate the referral."
Are outside providers covered by U-SHIP?,"Outside providers, including psychiatrists, are covered by U-SHIP. SCS maintains a list of in-network therapists who accept U-SHIP insurance. When the cost of seeing an outside provider (such as insurance co-pays) presents an obstacle to a student receiving services, UChicago Student Wellness will work with the student to try to find lower-cost options."
"If a student is referred to an outside provider, does that mean they will not be seen at UChicago Student Wellness?","Students often continue to meet with a UChicago Student Wellness provider for “bridging sessions” until treatment with an outside provider is established. Students who are working with outside providers continue to have access to walk-in and after-hours crisis services. Sometimes a student will see an outside provider for therapy, and a UChicago Student Wellness provider for psychiatric care. Additionally, a student may see an outside provider for a period of time, and then may return to UChicago Student Wellness for additional services in the future. Finally, students who are referred to an outside provider are always encouraged to let their UChicago Student Wellness therapist know if there is any difficulty in establishing care with the outside provider, including a desire for another referral."
"If students, faculty, or staff are concerned about a student’s mental health, to whom can they turn for help?","UChicago Student Wellness is available for consultation 24 hours a day for emergent issues. Anyone with a concern about a student’s mental health is encouraged to reach out to UChicago Student Wellness during or after hours for consultation. In addition to UChicago Student Wellness services, concerned individuals have access to the University’s emergency response services, such as the (773.834.HELP)."
"If a student doesn’t want to go to UChciago Student Wellness, what other options are there?","Students who are reluctant to access traditional therapist services have access to anonymous, drop-in, one-on-one consultations with UChicago Student Wellness clinicians through the ."
How can UChicago Student Wellness ensure confidentiality?,"It is entirely the student’s choice whether or not to discuss use of the UChicago Student Wellness with family (including parents), friends, and University personnel. Other than authorized UChicago Student Wellness staff, no one will have access to student mental health records without the student’s signed consent. They will not become a part of the student’s academic record, and even the fact that the student came to UChicago Student Wellness will not be shared with anyone inside or outside the University without the student’s permission, except as permitted by law."
How does UChicago Student Wellness communicate with parents whose children are receiving services?,"Except in rare circumstances related to acute risk, UChicago Student Wellness providers need permission from a student to communicate with parents about their care."
How can the health promotion programming available through UChicago Student Wellness benefit students?,"UChicago Student Wellness health promotion programming empowers you to make healthy lifestyle choices to advance your academic, personal, and professional goals. We utilize evidence-based practices and apply UChicago health behavior data to create programming tailored for you. We focus our efforts on seven key Facets of Wellness to develop innovative initiatives that address the needs of our students by utilizing a public health approach to wellness. We work collaboratively with campus partners to enhance the UChicago community to promote lifelong healthy behaviors and empower students to improve their quality of life and reach their highest potential."
What are the Facets of Wellness?,"Wellness is more than just physical health, exercise, or nutrition. The Facets of Wellness framework is a way to show that in order to achieve holistic wellness, one has to find balance among each of these facets. Each facet contributes to healthy living in its own way and they interact together to help determine your full quality of life. One of UChicago Student Wellness's goals is to enhance the environment and community at the University of Chicago to promote lifelong healthy behaviors and to empower individual students to improve their quality of life and reach their highest potential. We do this by working collaboratively with campus partners to focus on all facets of wellness."
Why does UChicago require me to have health insurance?,"While the Student Health and Counseling clinics can provide primary care for students who pay the , students often incur additional medical expenses for medications, laboratory work, hospitalizations, and specialty care. It is important that students are able to receive appropriate health care when necessary, without undue financial burden. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act requires most individuals to have health insurance that meets certain standards of coverage."
What happens if I do not elect to enroll or waive coverage by the set deadline?,"You will be automatically enrolled in annual U-SHIP coverage and charged the premium, in three quarterly installments. The coverage will not be prorated and will be effective September 1. It is important to remember that being default enrolled in U-SHIP due to inaction is binding for the full year (September through August of the following year)."
How are U-SHIP charges assessed?,"For students who enroll at the University in Autumn Quarter, U-SHIP is billed in three quarterly (Autumn, Winter, and Spring) installments on your student account. Regardless of which quarter a student enters the University, the Spring Quarter premium provides coverage from the start of Spring Quarter through August 31. Students whose first quarter of enrollment is Summer Quarter will be billed for that period’s premium on their Summer bill."
Do any academic programs cover the cost of U-SHIP?,"Some PhD programs will cover the cost of U-SHIP for certain students. The insurance premium will be posted on the quarterly student account, and the charges will be paid for by the academic department. If you are a PhD student and have questions, please contact your for more information."
What is a mid-year qualifying life event?,In certain special cases it may be necessary to change health insurance coverage during the middle of the plan year (“mid-year change”). Specific circumstances that may qualify for a change in insurance enrollment in the middle of the plan year include:
Does my insurance cover dental and/ or vision?,"No, U-SHIP does not include coverage for dental or vision; however, all students enrolled in U-SHIP are automatically enrolled in UnitedHealth Allies Discount Program, which provides discounts on healthcare-related items that may not be covered under your plan. Voluntary dental and vision plans are available to all students regardless of U-SHIP enrollment for an additional cost. Students may enroll during open enrollment, which occurs twice a year for vision and dental: at the beginning of the academic year and during Winter Quarter. Information about the voluntary (optional) dental and vision programs can be found on the"
Do I have to waive U-SHIP every year?,"Yes, waivers are valid for one academic year. If you submit a waiver in Autumn 2018 you will not need to submit another waiver until Autumn 2019. If you submit a waiver in Spring 2019, you will need to submit another waiver for Autumn 2019. All waivers expire August 31."
"If I waive health insurance in one quarter, can I enroll in coverage another quarter?","Yes, but only if you have a qualifying mid-year event. If you have waived coverage one quarter, but need to elect coverage in a proceeding quarter due to a mid-year qualifying life event, contact the Student Insurance Office at or 773-834-4543 (Option 2)."
I enrolled in coverage. How long do I have to wait until I can see the doctor?,"After you confirm enrollment, your coverage is effective retroactive to the first day of the quarter (September 1 for Autumn Quarter). However, after you enroll in coverage, please allow two business days for processing. Once your application is processed, you will be able to print out your insurance card online through your UnitedHealthcare MyAccount. If you have a healthcare emergency, or if you need to see a doctor more urgently than two days, your coverage will be effective immediately, but you may need to pay more money up front and be reimbursed. For questions, please contact the Student Insurance Office at or 773-834-4543 (Option 2)."
"If I enroll in U-SHIP, how much will I have to pay for healthcare?","Once you enroll in U-SHIP and pay the premium, you will be responsible for meeting the annual deductible on U-SHIP (i.e., the first $500 of your medical costs) before your insurance begins to cover additional medical costs. After your annual deductible has been met, you will be responsible for a percentage of the cost of obtaining medical care. More information about the costs associated with receiving care while covered by U-SHIP is available on"
Am I required to get a referral from UChicago Student Wellness before I seek treatment off campus?,"Yes, a referral is required before seeking care or treatment from a provider outside of UChicago Student Wellness. Once you are issued a referral from UChicago Student Wellness, it will be entered in UnitedHealthcare's referral system within 24 hours and valid for your lifetime. Without a referral, services you receive off-campus will be subject to a $50 deductible non-referral fee."
"Does this plan cover me when I am off campus, traveling, or studying abroad?","Yes, U-SHIP covers you during quarterly breaks, summer vacation, and even if you’re traveling or studying abroad. You’ll be covered for the period for which you are enrolled and premiums are paid. In addition to being covered for medical treatment and services, you will also be covered for Emergency Medical Evacuation, Repatriation of Remains, Security and Political Evacuation, Natural Disaster Evacuation, and 24-hour worldwide travel assistance services through UnitedHealthcare Global.

1. How does therapy work?,"Therapy is interpersonal treatment for problems in living. It involves talking with a trained professional about conditions ranging from depression and anxiety to relationship conflicts and career frustrations. Therapy provides ways to express feelings, understand patterns of thinking, gain perspective on past events and current relationships, set goals, and clarify dreams for the future. Therapy can both alleviate pain and suffering and add meaning and richness to life. Therapists employ a range of techniques and methods, some suited to particular mental health issues and some that can be applied to clients dealing with a variety of issues. All therapists seek to increase their clients’ mental health and to act as a confidential and careful listener."
2. What is an LPC (licensed professional counselor)?,"Licensed professional counselors (or in some states, “licensed clinical professional counselors” or “licensed mental health counselors”) provide mental health and substance abuse care to millions of Americans. LPC’s are at least master’s level mental health service providers, trained to work with individuals, families, and groups in treating mental, behavioral, and emotional problems and disorders."
3. What is an LMFT (licensed marriage and family therapist)?,"Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) are mental health professionals trained in psychotherapy and family systems, and licensed to diagnose and treat mental and emotional disorders within the context of marriage, couples and family systems. MFT’s are a highly experienced group of practitioners, who average 13 years of clinical practice in the field of marriage and family therapy. They evaluate and treat mental and emotional disorders, other health and behavioral problems, and address a wide array of relationship issues within the context of the family system."
"4. What is an NCC (national certified counselor)? The National Board for Certified Counselors, Inc. and Affiliates (NBCC), an independent not-for-profit credentialing body for counselors, was incorporated in 1982 to establish and monitor a national certification system, to identify those counselors who have voluntarily sought and obtained certification, and to maintain a register of those counselors.","NBCC’s certification program recognizes counselors who have met predetermined standards in their training, experience, and performance on the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE), the most portable credentialing examination in counseling. NBCC has approximately 42,000 certified counselors. These counselors live and work in the US and over 50 countries. The NBCC examinations are used by more than 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam to credential counselors on a state level. NBCC’s flagship credential is the National Certified Counselor (NCC)."
5. How is a psychiatrist different than a professional counselor?,"A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can order medical tests and prescribes medication. It takes many years of education and training to become a psychiatrist. After earning a bachelor’s degree, he or she must graduate from medical school and go on to complete four years of residency training in the field of psychiatry. Most, but not all psychiatrists, will see a patient for medication evaluation and diagnosis but not do the “talk therapy” part of therapy or will do only a limited amount. They will continue to follow up with their patient to insure that prescribed medication is working properly and their patients are receiving the proper dosage."
"6. Is medication really necessary? Consultation with a psychiatrist is often an effective way of determining if medication is necessary. The decision as to whether to take medication such as an antidepressant or an antianxiety drug is a decision that is best made in dialogue between the client, doctor, and therapist (and parents if the client is a minor).","If the problem that brings someone into therapy has been chronic and/or persists even after therapy begins, then medication may be a necessary component of the total treatment plan. Once medication has been taken for awhile, it is also best to never discontinue medication without first consulting your psychiatrist."
7. How do I know if I need therapy?,"If you have been trying for some time to change your way of thinking or a behavior that is creating problems for you but simply cannot achieve any lasting results, then it may be time to seek help. If your life changes dramatically due to a painful loss such as the loss of a job or a significant relationship, and you realize you are unable to recover like you wish to, then it may be time to seek therapy."
8. How much does therapy usually cost?,"Most psychotherapy is paid for by the “session” — usually 45-50 minutes. The per-session cost to the client varies widely. It can be zero in a public agency setting, where the practitioner is paid a salary by the agency to counsel its clients."
What services does SCS provide?,"SCS offers a variety of services including individual counseling, group therapy, medication management, consultation to students, staff, and faculty, educational programming/outreach, as well as crisis intervention and referral services."
What kind of problems do you treat?,"SCS counselors work with students who experience difficult times personally (e.g., an academic struggle, relationship ending, social difficulties) as well as common mental health concerns such as:"
How do I know whether I should utilize SCS services?,"If you have questions about if counseling is right for you, a consultation with our professional staff may help you answer the question of whether you should consider counseling. To initiate services, please call our office at (540) 831-5226 to schedule your initial consultation.
If you have a specific question, please feel free to contact the Student Counseling Services at (540) 831-5226."
I think my friend should talk to someone at SCS. What can I do?,"It might be helpful for you to have a consultation with one of our counselors. Encourage them to reach out to our office at (540) 831-5226 to schedule an appointment. While you cannot counsel your friend or force them to go to counseling, there may be ways to talk with them about your concerns and share with them the resources you know about (i.e. counseling services or other community services). We can walk you through this conversation depending on the situation as well as provide you with support."
Who is eligible for services at SCS?,"Currently enrolled students are be eligible for services at SCS. In rare situations, staff may refer students whose concerns are beyond the scope of this office to effectively treat. Examples of possible concerns that may result in outside referrals include the following: students who have been psychiatrically hospitalized possibly due to a temporary detention order; students with severe drug abuse or dependence; and students who are non-compliant or create a hostile work environment. SCS staff will assist students in finding appropriate local referral sources when any of these situations occur. Students are always eligible for emergency assessments as needed."
How do I initiate services?,"If you are interested in starting services, please call our office at (540) 831-5226 to schedule your initial consultation.. You will meet with a clinician at that time for a 15-20 minute consultation where you and the clinician will talk about your concerns and decide what the best service is for you and will get you scheduled for your first appointment."
What if I am in crisis and need to talk with someone right away?,"If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call the university Campus Police at (540) 831-5500 or 9-1-1. If you are experiencing a mental health emergency that is not life-threatening call (540) 831-5226 and SCS will work to meet with you as quickly as possible often within the same day. We are available in the office on Monday through Friday from 8 a.m-5 p.m. You can also utilize our community mental health hotlines that are available 24/7 - ACCESS at (540) 961-9400 or CONNECT at (800) 284-8898."
What can I expect from my first appointment?,"During your first appointment, you will be asked to complete the necessary paperwork. You will then meet in-person with one of our counselors for 15-20 minutes to discuss your concerns. The counselor will gather some information and relevant history in order to gain a better understanding of your concerns and determine which services will best meet your needs. This may involve individual counseling, group therapy, seeing a psychiatrist, or a referral to a community provider who can better meet your needs. The counselor will discuss this with you thoroughly. If individual counseling is deemed appropriate, you will be scheduled for an intake appointment."
What should students expect in counseling?,"Counseling is a type of learning about oneself, one's feelings, and one's relationships with others. As in any learning environment, students will benefit most if they participate actively, attend sessions on time and are open and honest with the counselor.
In turn, the counselor will listen to the student's concerns, assist him/her in setting and reaching appropriate goals and will respect his/her confidentiality. Our staff abides by the ethical principles of our pertinent licensing boards and students can expect to have services delivered in a professional, legal and ethical manner."
What if I don’t like my counselor or if I am not happy with the treatment?,"SCS policy is for the student to inform the counselor if possible about any concerns about the therapy process. SCS therapists are often able to make changes in the focus or style of therapy preferred if they are informed. If the student is unable to address this directly or if the changes made are not sufficient, then a consult can be arranged with the SCS Assistant Director to determine if a change in therapist or outside referral is needed. Please tell your therapist or an office associate if you would like to schedule a consult."
Does SCS prescribe psychiatric medication?,Yes; the psychiatrist (located in Student Health Services in Moffett Hall) can evaluate students for medications and prescribe them as needed during the fall and spring semesters. Students must first have an initial consultation appointment with a counselor and complete mental health screening questionnaires before a referral/intake appointment with the Psychiatrist can be made.
Can I get my ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) medications from the psychiatrist?,"If a student has previously been diagnosed with ADHD and has received medications from a home provider, the student should continue to receive the ADHD medication from that provider for continuity of care.
If the student presents with a more complex case in which the student may need closer monitoring, the psychiatrist may prescribe medications in conjunction with a treatment plan with the home provider."
Does SCS have a limit on the number of sessions a student can be seen?,Counseling at SCS is based on a short-term model in order to help all students. There is a 6 session limit for traditional counseling (50 minute sessions) and a 12 session limit on brief counseling (30 minute sessions).
How much does it cost to see a professional at SCS?,Students are not charged when they receive services at our office. There is a $25 no-show/late-cancellation fee for appointments that are not attended or cancelled without 24-hours notice.
What is the SCS policy on confidentiality?,"SCS adheres to professional ethical standards and all state and federal laws regarding confidentiality. All information is confidential unless you sign a written release of information. There are some exceptions by law, (e.g., harm to yourself or someone else and ongoing child or elder abuse or court subpoena). In these cases, the pertinent laws, professional ethics and the best clinical practices will dictate our response to the information presented to our counselors."
"If a person has been victim of sexual assault or is a survivor of child sexual abuse, is SCS required to report the information to the university reporting mandate?",SCS staff are not Title IX mandated reporters and are therefore able to keep this information private and confidential.
"Will my parents, faculty, and/or others be informed that I am going to SCS?",No. SCS does not release information about student involvement without written permission from the student.
What if I am under 18? Can I receive services without parental consent?,"Yes. Unless you have signed a written release of information, we cannot speak to anyone about treatment received at SCS. Students under 18 may consent to mental health treatment and may be seen at SCS without parental notification. However, a minor's parents do have the legal right to request and receive mental health treatment records, unless the treating mental health professional determines that the release of said records would be reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the minor. It is SCS practice to discourage parents from requesting such information so that a trusting working relationship can be established."
Will the fact that I am seen at SCS be on my academic record?,"No, SCS records are kept separately from academic records."
Can SCS help me find a therapist off-campus?,"Yes. One of the services SCS provides is assisting students in connecting with services in the community, when requested."
What will be expected of me?,"SCS staff will expect you to be on time for your appointments and to give 24 hours notice of cancellation if possible. Providers will want you to be honest and open with your feelings and behaviors so that you can receive the most benefit from your care.
***There is a $25 fee for any scheduled appointment that a student does not attend or does not cancel with at least a 24-hour advance notice.***"

It is a cohort based experience, so you will be traveling through the classes and internship with the same group of students."
Why isn't there an interview as part of the admissions process?,"First, our program strives to both practice and teach principles that are supported by research. The research around admissions interviews shows that they do not help a program to make better choices for admissions. There is some evidence that including unstructured interviews in screening actually makes a program make worse choices."
What is the GRE or TOEFL requirement?,"We accept the Graduate Record Examination General Test (GRE). We do not accept the GRE Psychology Subject Test. It is recommended that this exam be completed well in advance of the application deadline. Applicants typically have a combined score of 300 on the verbal and quantitative sections.

Q. What do genetic counselors do?,"A. Genetic counselors work in many areas of medicine including cancer, prenatal, pediatric, and adult. Some genetic counselors specialize in areas such as cardiology, neurology, and infertility, among many others. In addition, some genetic counselors work outside clinical practice in research, education, public health and industry settings.
While their roles may vary depending on specialty, all genetic counselors in a clinical setting help patients and families understand complex issues and support their emotional needs. Genetic counselors are very good at interpreting test results and explaining information to patients in way that is easy for them to understand."

Most genetic counselors work in a clinic or hospital setting and specialize in general genetics, prenatal care and family planning, pediatrics, oncology, cardiology, neurology, and many other areas of specialized medical care.
Not all genetic counselors work directly with patients. Some genetic counselors work in related areas such as laboratories, research, education, public health settings, and corporate environments. While most genetic counseling is provided in-person, access to genetic counselors is expanding, and many now provide consultation services by telephone, videoconferencing, and the internet, or offer education and support in group settings."

In many cases, it pays for genetic testing when it is recommended by a genetic counselor or doctor. However, before having any genetic tests, it is important to check with your insurance company to verify coverage. Different companies have different policies. Some cover certain tests but not others. As with most healthcare services, you may need to pay for some of the cost.
"
Q. Can I have genetic testing without seeing a genetic counselor?,"A. You can have genetic testing without seeing a genetic counselor. Your doctor can order tests and provide you the results. However, because your doctor may not be an expert in genetics, you may receive results that you don't understand and you may have additional questions that leave you confused and worried. Genetic counselors have advanced training in medical genetics and counseling to interpret tests, and guide and support you as you seek more information about how inherited diseases and conditions might affect you or your family. Genetic counselors are able to keep up with the rapidly growing discoveries in genetics and can keep in contact with you if new recommendations come out or something new is discovered about your genetic variant.
Share this resource with your patients, payers, and fellow providers to help educate and inform others about critical points to consider throughout the genetic testing process."

What is Art Therapy?,"Art Therapy is a human service profession in which clients, facilitated by an art therapist, use the creative process and the resulting artwork to explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem. Art Therapy practice is grounded in the knowledge of human development, psychological theories, and counseling techniques.
Art Therapy is an effective treatment for persons experiencing developmental, medical, educational, and social or psychological impairment. It is often practiced in mental health, rehabilitation, hospital, and educational settings, and can be adapted to individual, couples, family, and group therapy formats."
What is required to practice as an Art Therapist?,"In general: Minimum educational and professional standards for the profession are established by the American Art Therapy Association, Inc. (AATA). Briefly stated, all practitioners must have a Master’s degree in Art Therapy and earn the Registered Art Therapist (ATR) credential (see details below). To see a list of approved graduate programs, visitwww.americanarttherapyassociation.org.
Additionally, each state has unique licensure requirements to practice in the mental health field (Licensed Professional Counselor, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Marriage and Family Therapist, etc.). Most art therapy and mental health Master’s programs are at least 2 years long, and graduates must complete a significant number of post-graduate supervised clinical hours as an intern in order to become fully credentialed/licensed."
What is the credentialing process for Art Therapists?,"One of the credentials offered by the Art Therapy Credentials Board, Inc. (ATCB) is the Registered Art Therapist (ATR) credential, which is conferred to applicants who provide appropriate documentation including the required education, practicum hours, postgraduate experience hours, and supervision.
ATCB also offers board certification to art therapists (ATR-BC). In order to become an ATR-BC, applicants must first successfully complete the ATR application process. Upon receipt of the ATR, applicants are eligible to apply for the ATR-Be. Successfully completion of the Art Therapy Credentials Board Examination (ATCBE) is required for the ATR-Be. The ATR-BC credential requires maintenance through proof of continuing education. In 2008, ATCB began offering the Art Therapy Certified Supervisor (ATCS) to applicants who demonstrate competence in this specialty area of art therapy practice."
How do I earn my ATR credential?,"It is important to understand an undergraduate degree in Art Therapy may be good preparation, but it does not qualify a person to practice as an Art Therapist. A Master’s degree is necessary, and all approved Art Therapy Master’s programs require applicants to have already obtained a minimum of eighteen (18) semester hour credits of study in studio art and a minimum of twelve (12) semester hour credits of study in psychology, which must include developmental psychology and abnormal psychology.
Before you enroll in a Master’s program, confirm that it is approved by the American Art Therapy Association and that it meets the requirements necessary to practice in the state where you plan to reside. A comprehensive list of AATA approved schools can be found at on their website."
How do I earn my ATR-BC credential?,"Once you have earned the ATR, you are immediately eligible to apply to take the Art Therapy Credentials Board Examination (ATCBE). In order to take the ATCBE, you must complete the current application form, which can be downloaded from www.atcb.org.
The application should be reviewed carefully and completed in detail. If you have any questions, please contact the ATCB National Office by email or phone. The exam is administered annually during the American Art Therapy Association’s Annual Conference and simultaneously in cities nationwide."
How much does art therapy cost?,The standard counseling fee for service is $120.00 for one 60 minute individual or family counseling session and $45.00 for one 60 minute group session. Financial assistance may be available based on family size and income level with proof of income. Several insurance plans are also accepted as a method of payment.
Do you accept insurance?,"The Art Station is participating as a provider for a number of insurance panels. Some examples of insurance plans currently accepted include Medicaid and CHIPS (Cook’s/Beacon Health, Amerigroup, Aetna, Superior and Traditional), Aetna, Blue Cross & Blue Shield, Cigna, Humana and United Healthcare. Call if you do not see your insurance plan on this list."
Do you offer group therapy?,"Yes, groups are offered based on client need. A list of current groups offered is found under the Services tab."
What ages do you serve?,"Clinical art therapy services are available for most ages. The Art Station staff generally works with school-aged children, teens and adults. While minimal communication and gross motor skills are necessary in art therapy, most services are adapted to the age and developmental needs of the individual child."
How do we begin services?,"If you are interested in receiving services at The Art Station, please call (817)921-2401 to determine the immediate availability of services."
What is telehealth/teleth﻿erapy?,"“Teletherapy” includes the practice of education, goal setting, accountability, referral to resources, problem solving, skills training, and help with decision making. Teletherapy counseling may include mental health care delivery, diagnosis, consultation, and psychotherapeutic treatment and will occur primarily through interactive audio, video, telephone, email, and/or other data communications. If one form of technology fails in the course of a teletherapy session, an alternate form of communication may be utilized by the counselor (ex. cell phone). Click for more information about teletherapy and our telehealth informed consent."
Why am I asked to sch﻿edule appointments by phone instead of via email or the web?,"We strive to protect confidentiality as much as possible. Email is not a secure form of communication, so we prefer scheduling students on the phone to protect privacy. Additionally, counselor schedules can change quickly, so we find it is ineffective to schedule via email, with time lapses between communications."
What can I expect if I come to the Counseling Service for an intake appointment?,"In the interest of accommodating a maximum number of clients, initial appointments are made on a first-come, first-served basis with special consideration for urgent requests.
Your first scheduled visit to the Counseling Service is considered a “consultation”, and it will generally last from 30 to 50 minutes. You will be asked to arrive 20 minutes early to complete initial paperwork. You will meet with a counselor to discuss your concerns and together you will select the best resources for your difficulties. If the level of services offered at Counseling Services seems sufficient to help you resolve your concerns and if you decide to continue counseling, your counselor will schedule a second appointment. If the counselor determines that you would be better served by another agency, they will make a referral to an appropriate resource in the community."
Why would a student benefit from joining a therapy group?,There are many potential benefits to group therapy. Read about them here.
What happens if I see my counselor on campus?,"If you see your counselor in public, you can be assured that their desire to protect your privacy remains of the utmost importance. Generally, we do not directly or initially acknowledge knowing students unless we have talked to them about this beforehand. We will take our cue from you; if you do not make eye contact, we will not either. If you say hello, we may say hello back and be friendly but will not engage you about talk about our work together in public spaces. Usually your counselor will talk to you about your preferences regarding familiarity outside the office in your first session."
What is the difference between a therapist and psychiatrist?,"A therapist can provide what is commonly called “talk therapy.” This type of provider meets with students to talk about their concerns, offer support and work with students to identify ways to improve their quality of life. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who sometimes provides therapy and is able to write prescriptions for medication."
What do I do if I don’t feel like my therapist is a good match for me?,"We want you to know that we do not take this personally!!! We strongly believe that you will not be able to have the best treatment possible if you do not feel a connection with your therapist. We encourage you to talk to your counselor about this directly, but we understand that can be uncomfortable. You can also call the front desk and note that you would like to see another therapist. Our administrative assistant can schedule you to meet with another therapist, or you can request to speak with a counselor to help determine who at VCCS might be a good match for you."
How does confidentiality work?,"The information you share with your counselor is confidential. We do not share any information about you or even that you have come to VCCS with anyone outside of VCCS without your written permission. VCCS staff follow all state laws and ethical guidelines of our professions. The Counseling Service reserves the right to determine if you are able to keep yourself safe, if you are a danger to others, and if you are unable to exercise good judgment.
The exceptions to the rule of confidentiality are the following:"
"Can my counseling records be accessed by anyone outs﻿ide of the counseling service, in or outside of the college?","The Counseling Service keeps records as regulated by the New York State Mental Health Code. Maintenance of records is in accordance with professional, legal, and ethical guidelines. Other than authorized Counseling Service staff, no one, including College officials, faculty, parents, potential employers, among others have access to any of your records without your written permission. An Authorization to Release Information Form is used for written permission."
What is Counseling Service’s role in the Student Support Network (SSN)?,"The director of VCCS is a member of the SSN and serves as a consultant. No information from VCCS is shared with SSN without a student’s written permission. The VCCS director listens to the concerns voiced and provides consultation to the committee about how to best approach a student with care and concern, and what resources may be helpful to that student."
"If a student takes a medical leave, what role does the Counseling Service play in the reentry process?",The Dean of Students manages the reentry process and makes all related administrative decisions. The Dean of Students often requests that the Director or Assistant Director of VCCS review a student’s reentry paperwork and consult with the student’s doctor to clarify their current functioning and what supports they need to have in place upon their return to maximize their chance of success in their reentry. The Director or Assistant Director of VCCS then communicates this information to the Dean of Students who makes a clearance decision.
How/when does the Counseling Service talk to parents?,"We are happy to talk to parents as appropriate in the treatment of a student. We will do so if a student signs an Authorization to Release Information form. We must also get permission for on-going counseling for parents of students under 18. In most other cases when parents talk to us, we will not confirm or deny we work with a particular student. An exception to this is when a student is at high, imminent risk of harm to self or others and we must talk to parents in an effort to keep a student or others safe.
If a parents calls to express concern or ask questions about their student and we do not have a release, we will let them know that we can record information they wish to provide in case that student ever has contact with VCCS, but cannot provide any specific information to them about a student. We can provide general guidance to parents about how to best support students and how to access campus resources."
What can I expect if I come to the Counseling Service for a crisis visit?,"When you request a crisis visit, you will likely be seeing that day’s on-call staff counselor for a brief session. If it is your first appointment of the academic year, regardless of if you’ve seen someone at VCCS in the past, you will need to complete paperwork. You will then meet briefly with a therapist to talk about your concerns, assess your mental health and ability to keep yourself safe, and develop a plan to help manage your concerns. Depending on your concern, you may be scheduled for a subsequent full-length session, referred to an off-campus provider if you are in need of longer-term or specialized treatment, or in extreme circumstances- when you cannot guarantee you can keep yourself or others safe- transported to the hospital for a fuller psychological evaluation."
What can I expect if I call the Counselor-on-Call?,"When you talk to the Counselor-on-Call, you will be talking to a licensed mental health professional at ProtoCall, our on-call service. You will be asked to provide some basic information about yourself for their records, and so VCCS staff can follow up with you if needed. You will then have freedom to talk about your concerns and they will help you identify action steps toward resolving your problem. If your problem is of an urgent or emergent nature, you may also then talk to a VCCS therapist, who serves as back-up on call to ProtoCall counselors. All calls made to ProtoCall are summarized and sent to VCCS counselors so we can follow up as appropriate or needed."
Why would a student be sent to the hospital for a psychological assessment?,"A student would be sent to the hospital for a psychological assessment in circumstances in which a student cannot guarantee they can keep themselves and/or others safe, a counselor will work with the student to get them to a psychiatric emergency room for evaluation, stabilization and/or further treatment recommendations."
What happens when a student is sent to the hospital for a psychological assessment?,"If it is determined that a student must be sent to the hospital, the counselor you are with will call the CRC to request ambulance transport to the hospital. An ambulance is used to protect the safety of the student. When the ambulance arrives, the medics talk to the student and your counselor to get details of what is happening. The medics are trained to be sensitive and supportive in these situations. The medics may be provided with a printed copy of demographic information, as well. The student is then transported to the hospital.
Once at the hospital, a student is checked in and will wait for a psychiatrist to perform a mental health evaluation. This may take a short amount of time or you may have to stay overnight, depending on the time of day you are transported."
What happens if a student talks about suicidal thoughts in a counseling session?,"We frequently work with students who express suicidal thoughts in session. The counselor will work with the student to understand the distress that is behind thoughts of suicide. In most situations, a counselor and student will work together to create a plan of action to help a student stay safe. This plan usually includes identifying methods of self care, distraction, and people to reach out to for help. The plan may at times include, with the student’s agreement, involving parents or other supportive “adults” in the student’s life so that the student does not have to manage the feelings outside of session on their own. In extreme circumstances in which a student cannot guarantee they can keep themselves safe, a counselor will work with the student to get them to a psychiatric emergency room for evaluation, stabilization and/or further treatment recommendations."
Do you send students home or put them on a required leave because of mental health concerns?,"No. VCCS does not send students home or put them on a required leave because of mental health concerns. In instances where students need a higher level of care to attend to mental health needs, we work in collaboration with a student’s other treatment providers and often family to help identify what services the student needs and how to get them into treatment. This may result in a student deciding to take time off from school either at home or somewhere they can receive a higher level of treatment than what we or the local community can provide."
When are students referred off campus for treatment?,Students are referred off-campus for treatment for various reasons:
"If I am interested in seeing a therapist or psychiatrist off campus, what steps should I take?","You can use your insurance to find a provider off-campus. In order to do this, go to the website on your insurance card and log in. There will be a “Find a Provider” link. You can usually search for specific criteria, such as gender, language spoken or distance from you, as well as specialty."
"If I don’t have the resources to pay for off campus mental health treatment, what are my options?","If you qualify for a Pell Grant or are an international student whose financial situation would make you Pell Grant equivalent, you are eligible to access the Mental Health and Wellness Fund through the Dean of Students office. We encourage you to call or email Dean Luis Inoa to request information about how to access the fund and for specific details about using the fund. Generally, students who use this fund can submit requests for reimbursement for travel expenses and co-payments for mental health services off-campus. Usually you can only get reimbursed for one appointment per week."
How can I provide feedback about my experiences at the Counseling Service?,"You can provide feedback by talking to your counselor in person, talking to the director, Wendy Freedman by phone at 845-437-5700 or you can provide anonymous feedback through our website: https://counselingservice.vassar.edu/feedback/."
Why would I want to talk to a therapist?,"People usually decide to talk to a therapist when the pain of what they are trying to cope with becomes too big for them to handle on their own and they recognize they need help.? For more ideas, this previous blog post gives 10 reasons why you may want to see a therapist."
How can I find a therapist?,"Once you’ve decided that you would like to speak to a therapist, here are a few different ways to find one:
Referral from a friend or family member.? While seeing a therapist is not something we often share with others, in our close relationships we may know of someone who is.? If you feel comfortable disclosing to this person, you can ask if they are happy with their therapist and ask for their contact information."
What should I be looking for?,"There are lots of very good therapists out there–doing all types of therapy.? However, studies show that more important than the type of therapy, the biggest indicator of client success is the therapeutic relationship that develops between the therapist and client.? In other words…there needs to be a ‘good fit’.
If possible, have a phone or email conversation when you first make contact with a potential therapist.? Ask if this person has experience in helping people to deal with your area of concern.? If that goes well, then book a first meeting.? You will have to pay for the first session, but it’s money well-spent if you decide that this isn’t the therapist for you.? Trust your instincts.? Your friend may feel comfortable with their therapist, but that doesn’t mean she’s ‘your’ therapist."
What happens in a therapy session?? Do I have to lie on a couch?,"Lying on a couch is no longer required!? Instead, clients come into an office (that’s usually quite comfortable) and talk to the therapist.? Sometimes the therapist will have a plan for what to talk about during that session; at other times, the client drives the conversation.
I’ve found it helps clients to have an idea of what will happen in a session, so I have a basic structure.? The session starts with the client telling me about what has been happening for them since our last meeting.? We check in on any homework that was suggested.? I ask the client if there is anything they want to talk about.? Normally the client has outlined goals for therapy (what they would like to be different when therapy is finished) and that always provides areas for conversations."
How long will I be in therapy?? Do I have to go forever?,"While therapists learn various types of therapies (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Emotionally Focused Therapy, etc.), therapy is also an art.? Every client is different, with different needs for the amount of time they will be seeing a therapist.
Personally, I operate from the perspective of ‘this is your therapy’ and you get to choose.? If a client is in crisis, then I suggest meeting weekly until things become more stable.? Once the crisis is past, we move to bi-weekly or even monthly.? It depends on what the client chooses as well as what is in their best interest therapeutically.? Ethically, a therapist shouldn’t want a client to have to come forever.? The overall goal is that people feel better and go back to their lives."
How does confidentiality work?,"Basically, whatever you say in therapy, stays in therapy.? However, there are times when a therapist is legally obligated to break confidentiality:"
"My benefits plan covers services provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychotherapist or social worker.??What’s the difference?","Since each of these professionals can provide mental health services, it can be confusing to figure out which one is right for you.? The best way to explain it is by breaking down the services they provide.
Psychiatrist:? A psychiatrist is a medical doctor (MD) who has done extra training in psychiatry.? Psychiatrists are able to diagnose a mental health issue, such as schizophrenia, and prescribe any necessary medication.? Some psychiatrists provide therapy to their patients, but due to the shortage of psychiatrists, in my experience they usually? provide diagnosis and medication management.? Psychiatrists may refer their patients to counsellors for therapy."
"I don’t have benefits, and can’t afford to pay out of pocket.? Is there anywhere I can go?","Seeing a therapist is expensive and not everyone is covered under benefits.? Some therapists provide a sliding scale or see different groups of clients at a discounted rate.? Many agencies (KW Counselling, Carizon, etc.) have a sliding scale based on income.? As well, agencies such as KW Counselling offer free weekly drop in counselling services.
Making the decision to talk to a therapist takes courage…and studies show that counselling works!"

What is a pastoral counselor?,"Certified pastoral counselors are ordained ministers who have graduated from an accredited seminary and have three or more additional years of clinical training in crisis intervention, psychological studies, and behavioral health skills. Most pastoral counselors also receive an additional master’s degree during their three or more years of clinical training. In the CareNet system, pastoral counseling remains our dominant discipline. We have added other specialists such as clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family therapists, substance abuse counselors, adolescent and children’s counselors, and certified clinical social workers to our professional staff. This ensures an interdisciplinary approach to treating the whole person—mind, body, and spirit."
When should I seek help from a pastoral counselor?,A pastoral counselor is trained in both psychology and theology and thus can address psychological and spiritual issues. You should consider meeting with a pastoral counselor if you are experiencing emotional difficulties and wish to address these matters in the context of religion and spirituality.
How does “pastoral counseling” differ from “counseling”?,"Pastoral counseling is very much like the counseling that you would receive from any other counseling professional (psychotherapist, licensed social worker, psychologist), except that pastoral counselors also have been trained in issues of spirituality and faith. When counselees seek to integrate their faith and religious understanding into how they address their problems, a pastoral counselor can competently facilitate this process."
Are fees of pastoral counselors comparable to those charged by other health care professionals?,"In general, the fees of pastoral counselors are lower than those of other health care professionals. This is due to the not-for-profit orientation of pastoral counseling centers and the willingness of pastoral counselors to work for modest salaries. It is the prevailing ethic of pastoral counseling that every effort is made to treat everyone, regardless of ability to pay."
When should a pastor refer a congregant to a pastoral counselor?,"Counseling and support are considered an integral part of any pastor's ministry. However, there are times when the needs of a congregant go beyond offering support and encouragement to encompass longer-term counseling and psychotherapy. This is especially important, for instance, when a pastor suspects the problem may be clinical depression—a debilitating medical illness. Only a physician or mental health professional is able to diagnose clinical depression and other mental illnesses.
A pastor should refer a congregant to a pastoral counselor when the congregant desires an integrated religious and psychological approach to treatment, and the pastor is unable to provide the most effective therapy needed by the individual."
Do pastoral counselors counsel people of faiths different from theirs?,"Pastoral counselors are found in every major Protestant denomination, as well as the Roman Catholic church and Jewish faith, and they do work with people of faiths different from their own. However, in practice, clients often prefer to work with a pastoral counselor who shares their faith and beliefs. In initial meetings, the subject of faith should be raised to ensure that client and pastoral counselor are comfortable with each other's perspective."
What type of person becomes a pastoral counselor?,"Just like in other counseling professions, there isn’t a stereotype of a pastoral counselor. All pastoral counselors believe that by integrating psychology and spirituality into the counseling experience you offer a more holistic approach to healing."
Do pastoral counselors preach to their clients?,No. Pastoral counselors respect the religious beliefs of their counselees and do not impart their religious convictions to them. Pastoral counselors help counselees use the resources of personal faith to respond to their presenting situation.

What license type do I need/want - Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC) or Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)?,"First, an applicant should determine the type of counseling practice that they want to engage in performing, i.e. clinical versus non-clinical. Clinical is defined as the ability to diagnose and treat mental health disorders."
What are the educational requirements of the LCPC license?,"Currently, there are three ways to meet the educational requirements for the LCPC license. First, a CACREP approved mental health counseling master's program consisting of 60 semester credit hours; second, a master's counseling degree from a program that consisted of a minimum of 60 semester hours or quarter-hour equivalent as an organized sequence of study that includes curricular experiences and demonstrated knowledge that substantially satisfies each of the 10 core areas of study described in Board Rules and is subject to a transcript review of the content requirements; or, third, a doctoral psychology degree in either clinical psychology or counseling psychology that is APA or CPA accredited."

Does a criminal conviction prevent me from applying for a license?,"The board requires all applicants who have been convicted of any crime (Class A, B, C, D, and E) to provide full disclosure of the crime on their application for licensure. Failure to disclose may result in a denial of licensure. Criminal convictions are reviewed by the board based on date of crime, nature of crime, and will determine sufficient rehabilitation to warrant the public's trust."
Do I need board permission to sit the NCE or the NCMHCE examinations?,"Yes -before applying for licensure, candidates are required to apply to sit for the NCE or NCMHCE examination. However, NBCC will permit a candidate to sit for the NCE examination independent of the Maine board if either the candidate's school enrolls them or if a candidate is applying for the NBCC credential. The following website contains more information regarding the examinations: www.nbcc.org"
Who is eligible to provide me licensing supervision?,"LCPC-Conditional licensees are required to obtain board approved clinical supervision. The supervisor can be a LCPC, LMFT, Licensed Pastoral Counselor, LCSW, CSW-IP, licensed psychologist, or licensed psychiatrist who meet the board's requirements."
Do post-master's employment hours in Maine count towards clinical counseling experience?,"No. In Maine, you must first obtain a conditional license to begin earning the 3,000 hours of clinical counseling experience. Providing clinical counseling to the public without first obtaining a license from the board may result in disciplinary action."
"What is the breakdown of the 3,000 hours of clinical counseling supervision required for the LCPC license?","A total of 3,000 hours is required with at least 1,500 hours gained in direct client contact. In addition, at least 100 hours of individual supervision must be gained - with no more than 50 hours earned in a group setting. The conditional license is a minimum two-year license that may be renewed twice only."
Does my employment position qualify me for the LCPC-Conditional license?,Your job responsibilities should include the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. The hallmark of the LCPC-Conditional license is to practice clinical counseling while under clinical supervision.
How do I keep track of my consultation hours - what if my supervisor leaves the agency or I leave the agency?,"The board rules require that a Proposed Supervision Plan be submitted to the board for pre-approval. A change in supervisor requires the former supervisor to submit a Supervisor's Affidavit form, and requires the conditional licensee to submit a new Proposed Supervision Plan with the new supervisor. A conditional licensee cannot practice without board approved supervision. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to accurately reflect the number of consultation hours on the form. Good record keeping by both the supervisor and licensee will ensure that hours are accurate."
"Do I need to continue with clinical supervision once my 3,000 hours are completed?",Yes. The scope of the LCPC-Conditional license requires clinical supervision whenever the licensee is actively practicing.
What are my ethical guidelines as I practice clinical counseling and where can I find them?,"The Maine Board of Counseling Professionals Licensure has adopted their own Code of Ethics and can be found in Chapter 8 of its rules entitled ""Standards of Practice."""
What if I do not have 900 hours as part of my clinical internship - how do I meet this educational requirement?,"The board permits the use of ""alternative experience"" to reflect lawfully gained clinical counseling experience via another clinical license type or post-master's clinical counseling experience gained in another state. Alternative experience for a clinical license cannot be gained in Maine without first obtaining a clinical license type. Most individuals who cannot document alternative experience will chose to re-enroll in a graduate level internship and finish the 900 hour requirement."
How does psychotherapy work?,"Psychotherapy includes a number of different types of therapy. Each one uses techniques intended to help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and some focus on making changes in behavior. And each psychotherapy has a theory for how those changes take place.
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) helps people become aware of their feelings and thoughts in order to change their behaviors. Specifically, cognitive behavior therapists use techniques and give clients tools to decrease self-defeating behaviors like procrastination, social isolation, avoidance, smoking, overeating, alcohol abuse, passive-aggressive behaviors, aggressive behavior, substance abuse, reassurance seeking, and many other behaviors that get in the way of living a more satisfying, meaningful, and happy life. CBT therapists also help clients learn new adaptive behaviors or increase their frequency. Those behaviors may include effective communication, greater productivity, increased physical activity, relaxation exercises, reading social cues, assertively asking for what you want, dating skills, etc."
How does psychotherapy help you?,"Psychotherapy at its best, reduces suffering as efficiently as possible, enhances existing strengths, and teaches you skills you don’t have yet that you need to build the life you want.
So the goal is really to help the client reduce suffering and increase vitality currently in psychotherapy in session with therapeutic techniques and with suggested exercises in between sessions. Work in between session is done to speed up the healing process and to cultivate self-confidence, real world practice, and greater independence. With enough practice clients learn how to use the skills to take care of themselves so they can leave therapy confident they can use the tools themselves as needed, while always knowing if additional support is needed they can return. But independence and autonomy are stressed. We don’t want therapy to decrease a client’s abilities or foster dependency."
What is the role of a therapist?,"Effective therapists function as both experts; conducting therapeutic techniques in session, educating clients about mental health issues and the scientific and research that supports the treatment of these issues, and as collaborative equal partners who recognize we are all in this together; empathizing and humanizing the experience of suffering and the path to healing and growth.

What is the difference between psychotherapy and counseling?,"Psychotherapy and counseling are often used interchangeably. Historically counseling was often taught in departments of education and may have focused on working with students and/or dealing with career development. Many counseling programs focused on strengths and were client focused. But there has always been a great variety of approaches within counseling.
More important than whether someone says they are providing psychotherapy or counseling is the specific theoretical approach, technical skills, and styles they use. For instance a counselor and a psychotherapist may both practice the same kind of therapy, while two psychotherapists could have two very different theories for how therapy works, use different techniques, and differ greatly in their personal style."
What is the difference between a therapist and a psychologist?,"Psychologists in New York State can be licensed professionals with doctoral degrees. This typically involves at least five years of graduate work, a clinical internship, passing of a licensure exam, and completing a number of supervised clinical hours. The requirements vary by state.
Anyone can call themselves a “therapist.” That doesn’t mean that someone referring to themselves as a therapist is not a licensed professional, it just doesn’t mean that they are. Licensing is done by the state, so different states license different kinds of professionals. If someone refers to him or herself as a therapist, it is a good idea to ask if he or she is licensed, and if so as what kind of a professional and what kind of training have they had."
Should you see a therapist or psychiatrist?,"This question differs depending on the person, symptoms, diagnosis, etc. The important thing if you are experiencing symptoms is to see a qualified professional who can accurately assess what you are experiencing and then recommend the appropriate kind of treatment.
As explained above, the word, “therapist” is a general term that could refer to anyone. Someone without any mental health education or training can call themselves a “therapist” in New York, but some very well trained social workers, psychologists, and other licensed professional therapists use the term as well."
What disorders can be treated with psychotherapy?,"Fortunately, there are many mental health disorders that can be effectively treated. There is scientific evidence that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Depression (Major Depressive Disorder), phobias, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and many other disorders can be effectively treated with certain kinds of therapy.
Unfortunately, there do remain some disorders that we have not yet demonstrated we can effectively treat and even for the disorders above, there are some people who do not improve as much as we would hope."
What do you do in psychotherapy?,"What takes place in psychotherapy will vary greatly depending on the kind of therapy and the particular psychotherapist. But it will often involve questions and exercises that help you become more aware of your values, goals, feelings, beliefs, behaviors, sensations, relationships and how all of these interact to produce your overall sense of satisfaction, meaning, and vitality (or when things aren’t going well dissatisfaction and unhappiness).
Then in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) it would involve the therapist using techniques and exercises in session and teaching the client to use tools outside of the therapy sessions to change behaviors and change or accept feelings and thoughts with the larger goal of enhancing satisfaction with life."
What happens during psychotherapy?,"What occurs during psychotherapy, as noted above, varies greatly by the type of therapy and the personal style of the therapist. Different therapists can be more or less active and directive in session. Some may do a lot more listening than speaking. Some may be very active and directive, asking very specific questions, conducting many exercises in session, while others may be more passive and give more space for the client to share as he or she thinks is important.
Effective therapy, in my opinion, typically requires ongoing assessment of what is needed in the moment with a particular client. Therefore while my sessions may have common elements to provide familiar structure, the content, pace, and style will be very different for different clients, and even for one client depending on the current mood and situation. Humor, the amount I speak or direct, question, or challenge depend on what would be most effective for that client in that session."
How long is a session with a therapist?,"Individual therapy sessions typically run from 30-55 minutes. There are clients and kinds of therapy where 80-90 minute sessions are also conducted.
Group therapy sessions can run from 45 minutes to two hours depending on the kind of group and the number of group members."
How much is a therapy session in nyc?,Psychotherapy in NYC can range from $125 to $450 per session. You will want to call the psychotherapist and ask what their rate is.
Is therapy covered under insurance?,"Therapy is frequently covered by insurance. Depending on your insurance plan you may have to see an in-network provider or you may have out-of-network coverage where you could see someone who isn’t in-network, but your insurance company will pay for a portion of the cost. You can call your insurance company and ask them if you have out-of-network coverage for individual psychotherapy.
That way you can know in advance what you can expect to pay. The last thing you want is to find out after finding a great therapist is that you are stressed by the cost, that defeats the whole purpose."
How do I find out if a therapist takes my insurance?,"You can call your insurance company and ask with a specific name or ask them to direct you to their website, where most insurance companies list the psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists who are on their insurance panels and accept in-network insurance.
"
How do you know when it is time to stop therapy?,"Ongoing assessment of your symptoms and your goals is a good idea for effective therapy. Together with your psychotherapist you want to discuss when stopping therapy or gradually tapering makes sense.
While some clients can continue to benefit from ongoing therapy, you never want to become dependent in a way that is countertherapeutic, i.e., decreasing self-reliance, confidence, or independence. Likewise therapy takes time and money, so those are resources to consider as well. No one should ever feel they can’t leave therapy. Therapists should happily have clients complete therapy when the client is ready. This should be a very open dialogue. At the same time, if the client is continuing to benefit, dependency isn’t being fostered, and has the resources, a client doesn’t necessarily have to discontinue therapy either. While suffering may have decreased, some clients continue to identify areas for growth and can build on that, as long as it is beneficial to the client and therapy isn’t continuing because the client feels guilty or the therapist can’t let go for some reason. Therapists should work as efficiently and effectively as possible to help clients achieve their goals as expediently as possible."
"Can therapy help? If I can talk to a smart, compassionate friend, why would I pay for therapy?","Therapy is not for everyone and it is not for every problem. Certainly good advice can come from a number of sources, including friends and family members. There are problems that require scientific and clinical expertise. There are also issues that may require careful assessment to determine what the actual problem is. And finally there may be issues that are so private in nature, revealing them to someone in a personal capacity may not be an option yet. There may also be chronic problems or unfulfilled dreams that people have been trying unsuccessfully to help you with. That is when effective therapy with an expertise in the area may be appropriate.
Some therapies are supportive and non-directive in nature. Therapy practiced in this office is active and directive. Concrete goals are set, barriers are identified, and interventions target removing barriers or giving clients the tools to navigate around them so they can achieve goals and live a happier, more satisfying, and meaningful life."
What kinds of problems might be addressed in therapy?,"Emotional problems, such as anger, anxiety, embarrassment, depression, and shame can be targeted. Therapy can help to reduce how often you experience these feelings and how intense they are. As you learn to change your feelings you will become more confident as you feel a sense of control. You will also learn how to behavior towards your goals even if you are experiencing an emotion. Once you are confident you are in more control of your life, you can continue to revise your life goals and get back to embracing the changes you want to make at work, with friends and family, and any other area of your life.
"
What happens in a therapy session?,"Therapy sessions will begin by going over how successful you were since the previous session in hitting your targets and what difficulties you had. We will then set an agenda, so we can efficiently use our time. We will be sure to take stock of why things went well, so it is clear how to ensure things can continue to go well. We will also utilize interventions to eliminate the existing problems by carefully analyzing them, and develop existing or new skills in order to better manage them in the coming week.
The goal is to effectively treat emotional and behavioral problems. We do this so clients can begin to live the kind of vital life that represents what is most important or valuable in their lives, not one that is dominated by escaping negative emotions or old behavioral patterns. Often times clients are not even conscious of the patterns of avoidance in their lives. Once you have the tools you can begin to clarify what is most important and move towards that, rather than fleeing from negative emotions and distressing thoughts."
How long are the therapy sessions?,"Individual therapy sessions are 45 minutes. Although there is a clear agenda and structure, there is still time to explore what is necessary to be sure that the client is really understood. Given the nature of emotional and behavioral problems, it is critical that the work doesn’t stop after 45 minutes. Assignments are given to be done in between sessions. Bad habits have typically been ingrained over years, and so the more practice that takes place outside of session, the sooner the problems can be resolved. In addition, often times the work required involves situations at work, home, and with people that are not going to be in the therapy session. So the sessions are 45 minutes, but we will use time outside of session to do the work as well."
What can I discuss in therapy?,"Anything can be discussed in therapy. There is great flexibility about topics and existential questions can be the main focus for a particular client. With that said, we will be goal focused. If the goal is to come to a greater understanding or acceptance of existential issues, then we will spend the appropriate time on that. Without being overly rigid, we will navigate back to the goals and the agenda when we go off course. If something new comes up though, we will simply add it to the agenda in order to incorporate it into the longer-term goals.
"
Who can I see for therapy?,"I am a clinical psychologist and I practice forms of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and behavioral therapy. These kinds of therapy include Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Traditional Behavior Therapy, etc. You could also speak to a mental health counselor or a social worker. In fact, anyone can call themselves a therapist. Therefore it is critical to inquire about professional licensure and the extent of expertise in terms of trainings, publications, etc."
What if I don’t feel comfortable with the therapist?,"At my practice there are a number of therapists. I always let potential clients know that we want to be sure they are incredibly comfortable with the fit. So if they are not very satisfied after three or four sessions, I encourage them to call me directly and I will arrange for them to see someone else. Honestly this has only occurred a few times in the years I have been doing this, and in those cases it had to do with a client realizing they would be more comfortable with a therapist of a different age or sex.
"
What is a psychiatrist?,A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with specialized training in diagnosing and treating emotional problems and mental illness.
What other kinds of clinicians can assess and treat mental health conditions?,"In addition to psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners have special training in treating mental health conditions. General physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners may also treat the most common mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression). CAPS Psychiatry employs psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners. We also have a psychiatric case manager to help connect students with psychiatry (and other) resources on and off campus."
What kind of conditions does a psychiatrist treat?,"Psychiatrists treat individuals in distress because of various difficulties, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and some types of behavioral problems, such as those involving self-destructive or violent impulses. Students seriously thinking of suicide can be helped. A number of emotional and mental difficulties are influenced by physical conditions; as a physician, a psychiatrist is in a position to take account of such conditions and coordinate overall care."
What kind of treatment is provided? Do psychiatrists only give out medication?,"CAPS Psychiatry staff conduct assessments to determine the best treatment plan and can prescribe medication for psychiatric illnesses and other situations requiring medication intervention. Psychotropic medications are useful and appropriate for some conditions, such as severe depression, bipolar disorder, and psychosis. However, they are not necessary in every case. Psychiatrists are trained to deal with the psychological and interpersonal aspects of difficulties, as well as prescription of medication. Often, therapy and/or a change in a life situation is the appropriate intervention. Psychiatry staff can assist with referrals to other CAPS, Health Center, or off-campus clinicians."
Do psychiatrists treat only serious cases?,No. Psychiatrists evaluate and treat individuals with a wide range of difficulties. This is true for those who seek out treatment themselves and those who are referred by others.
What if I am running out of medication?,"You should call the medical provider who is currently prescribing your medication to obtain additional prescriptions. If this is not possible and you will run out of medication before you are scheduled to see a CAPS Psychiatry practitioner, you may be able to get a one-time refill by calling your pharmacy or another doctor who has treated you. If not, contact CAPS for an initial assessment and let the counselor know your situation. We cannot guarantee that we can provide your prescriptions urgently, so do plan ahead."
What if I am currently experiencing an emergency?,"If you are experiencing a life-threatening condition or medical emergency, please call 911. If you are experiencing an urgent/crisis situation that is not immediately life-threatening, call CAPS at (831) 459-2628 or walk in during business hours. Our staff will assist you with taking the next steps. You can also call our After Hours Crisis Service on evenings, weekends, and holidays at (831) 459-2628 and follow the menu prompts to talk to a crisis counselor.
The UCSC Student Health Center does offer urgent medical care to students on a same-day basis, and you may walk in or call (831) 459-2500 for a same-day appointment. For after-hours medical emergencies, see the Student Health AFTER HOURS information for location and hours for urgent care and emergency department options off campus. The AFTER HOURS handout is also located in a box outside the entrance of the health center's same-day clinic."
What is Rehabilitation Counseling?,"Although the name “rehabilitation” is often associated with substance abuse or physical disability, the field of rehabilitation counseling is broad and includes providing professional counseling to individuals with a wide range of chronic illness, mental health and/or other disabling conditions (including sensory impairment disorder, addiction disorders, developmental, and physical disabilities) to help them live to their fullest potential and achieve individual goals. Click here for the full description of Rehabilitation Counseling."
What is Clinical Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counseling?,
What is unique about the Rehabilitation Counseling and Clinical Rehabilitation and Clinical Mental Health Counseling Curricula?,"In addition to taking all of the same core counseling coursework as their peers in other counselor education emphasis areas, rehabilitation counseling and clinical rehabilitation and clinical mental health counseling students take specialized coursework in the medical aspects of counseling, which helps to refine their expertise of the critical relationship between physical and mental health. This knowledge base is particularly relevant given the numbers of people seeking counseling services who have coexisting physical and mental health challenges. Additionally, in light of the key role that employment plays in all of our lives as a source of income, identity and social interaction, rehabilitation counseling students take course work that provides critical information about laws and resources available to help individuals find and/or maintain employment as well as practical skills on how to complete a job analysis and transferable skills assessments. These skills enable our graduates to address important civil and human rights and to help reduce poverty, stigma and social isolation of individuals with chronic health, mental health and/or other disabling conditions."
Can I tailor my program to focus on one primary disability?,
How long is the program?,"Students who already know that they are interested in working with a specific population (e.g., mental health, addictions, veterans, corrections, sensory impairment, autism or other developmental disability) can tailor their program through the choice of electives, focus of course assignments and selection of internship sites. However, students are not required to have a specialized focus when they apply to the program. Since the program provides a strong foundation for working with a wide variety of people with varied disabilities, it is not uncommon for graduates to work with varied populations throughout the course of their careers. Both the Rehabilitation Counseling emphasis and Clinical Rehabilitation and Mental Health emphasis take two years to complete with some course work during the summer of the first year."
Do I need to have a particular college major to apply for this program?,"The field of rehabilitation counseling is an exciting interdisciplinary field that draws upon expertise from the fields of psychiatry, sociology, business, medicine, disability studies, psychology, assistive technology and philosophy, among others. Applicants from a wide range of academic and/or professional disciplines are welcome to apply."
Can I apply to your program as an international student?,"Our program welcomes students from all different parts of the world who have an interest in becoming rehabilitation counselors and/or developing or advancing the mission of our program within their native countries. Given the clinical components of the program that require providing counseling services, English proficiency is required. International students are advised that they are not eligible for positions with the federal government including within the federal-state vocational rehabilitation services system."
What is the job outlook for Rehabilitation Counselors?,"According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook (2018), the employment for rehabilitation counselors is expected to grow by 10%) from 2018 to 2028, which is faster than the average for all occupations. The employment for Clinical Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counselors is expected to grow 22% from 2018 to 2028."
When was the rehabilitation counseling program established?,"The Pennsylvania State University was one of the first institutions to apply for and receive a training grant in rehabilitation counseling following the passage of Public Law 565. The Rehabilitation Counseling Project, as it was officially designated, was initiated in September 1955. The first year was devoted to program development and to a series of orientation institutes for newly employed counselors from the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The first class of 10 students was admitted in September of 1956. The program has expanded steadily since that time and has granted over 800 graduate degrees in rehabilitation counseling."
In what type of settings do rehabilitation counselors work?,"One question that is often asked by students who are contemplating pursuing the rehabilitation counseling master's emphasis is, ""What can I do with my degree when I finish?"" The answer depends upon student interest in serving particular rehabilitation client (consumer) populations, desired job functions within the spectrum of rehabilitation practice, and intended rehabilitation setting practice. For example, master's level rehabilitation counselors work in a variety of settings including schools, hospitals, mental health clinics, psychosocial rehabilitation programs, vocational evaluation units, comprehensive rehabilitation centers, independent living centers, prisons, employee assistance programs, private rehabilitation firms, insurance companies, inpatient and outpatient substance abuse facilities, university offices of disability services, and high school and university programs. While some students specialize in working with a particular rehabilitation clientele (e.g., persons with mental illness, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse), other students provide services to a wide variety of clientele. For the most part, however, master's level rehabilitation counselors tend to work with adult and young-adult (transition age) populations where vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation plays a primary goal in service delivery. Others go on to develop their own private practice."
What exam should I take to become a Licensed Counselor?,"Depending upon individual coursework, emphasis, electives, and previous work experience, students may be eligible to take the State Civil Service examination for a variety of rehabilitation careers (e.g., Drug & Alcohol Treatment Specialist, Rehabilitation Counselor, Youth Development Counselor). Each month a list of Civil Service examination dates with the respective employment vacancy position is published. Lists are available at the Career Development and Placement Center (CDPS) in 115 Bank of America Career Services Center and State Employment Services Offices throughout the Commonwealth.

Box 569, State Civil Service Commission Offices, Harrisburg, PA 17120, or on their website at ."
When am I eligible to take the Certified Rehabilitation Counselor exam?,"Both rehabilitation counseling and clinical rehabilitation and mental health counseling students are eligible to take the Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC) examination after they have completed three- fourths of their program of study. Students can take the CRC exam to be eligible for counseling licensure in PA. Students with Rehabilitation Services undergraduate degrees are not required to retake courses already completed for the undergraduate major (e.g., RHS 403), but they must complete 60 credits post-Bachelor's degree in order to graduate. This gives the students more options for electives to take for each class that they already completed as an undergraduate."

What is the most common type of music in music therapy?,"Music therapists utilize music as a therapeutic tool; the genre and type of instrument is tailored to the individual and to the goals that are established between the client and the music therapist. Since music choice/usage is tailored to each client’s needs and preferences, there is really no most common"" type of music or instrument. All styles of music have the potential to be useful in effecting change in a client’s or a patient's life. The individual's preferences, circumstances and need for treatment, and the goals established will help the trained music therapist determine what music to use."
What’s the difference between music therapy and listening to an iPod with headphones?,"We’ve had a lot of questions since the premier of the film “Alive Inside,” featuring the Music & MemorySM program that gives individuals the ability to access their preferred music whenever they desire.

What instrument does a music therapist need to play?,"Music therapists must also be trained, accomplished musicians. Common instruments used are guitar, piano, percussion, voice, etc., but a music therapist must be versatile and able to adjust to changing circumstances and many different instruments may be used within a therapeutic context. There is not one single instrument every music therapist needs to play in every session, but rather, music therapy students choose one instrument to be their major instrument of focus during their educational course of study and are given basic training on a variety of instruments. The choice of instrument or musical intervention used in a music therapy session is dependent upon goals and objectives, the client's preferences, and the music therapist's professional judgement.

How long do you keep my records on file?,"As required by State law, the Student Counseling Center keeps client records on file for 7 years at which point they are destroyed."
What should I do in an emergency?,"If you are having a mental health crisis, you are welcome to utilize our walk-in crisis times, Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Upon completion of paperwork, a counselor will review to determine if you meet our criteria for a same day appointment. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis outside of business hours, you may call the 972-UTD TALK (972-883-8255) 24 hours, 7 days a week to be connected to a Mental Health Professional over the phone."
How do I report troubling behavior of a student?,"If you have concerns about another student and wish to report their behavior, you may contact the Dean of Students office at 972-883-6391. If you are concerned about the safety of a student who lives on campus, please contact the UT Dallas Police Department at 972-883-2222 to have them perform a welfare check. If the student does not live on campus, you may contact their local police department. Per department policy, the Student Counseling Center is unable to perform welfare checks on students."
How do I make an initial appointment?,"New clients are required to complete registration forms in the Student Counseling Center before they can be scheduled. There is no appointment necessary to fill out the paperwork. However, we do ask that students arrive at least an hour before we close to do so."
What services does the Student Counseling Center provide?,The Student Counseling Center has a wide variety of services that can be prescribed as part of your individualized treatment plan. These services include:
What can I expect during my Initial Evaluation?,"During your first session, you will discuss your concerns and goals to assist both you and your counselor about how you can best be helped. At the conclusion of your initial evaluation, you will be prescribed an individualized treatment plan as listed above."
Do you offer counseling services for alumni?,"Our services are reserved for currently enrolled students at UT Dallas. However, we do have a Referral Coordinator on staff who can provide alumni with referrals in the community if needed."
How can I access community referrals if I am not able to get into the center during working hours?,"You can call 972-883-2575 or email Shelly Turner, Counseling referral coordinator at [email protected] to receive community resources that you can access."
How can I better understand my insurance benefits?,"You can call 972-883-2575 or email Shelly Turner, Counseling referral coordinator at [email protected] for education on understanding your insurance and how to use it."
What is the purpose of this website?,"The purpose of this website is to provide information about effective treatments for psychological disorders. The website is meant for a wide audience, including the general public, practitioners, researchers, and students. Our aim is similar to that of other notable organizations promoting evidence-based psychological treatments, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP), which is sponsored by the United States Substance and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

How is this website related to the original list of empirically-supported treatments?,"This Division 12 website is an updated, online version of the original list of empirically-supported treatments. The original list was published in 1995 as part of a Division 12 Task Force report, and the list was updated several times over the next few years. However, approximately 15 years elapsed since the last update, creating the need for an updated version amenable to frequent revisions. The online nature of this website will allow for regular updates.
Under the leadership of Past-President David Tolin, Division 12 ratified a motion to update the way in which empirically supported treatments are evaluated, in part to bridge the gap between the Chambless criteria, developed 20 years earlier, and the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines underway by the APA. (For a thorough discussion and description, please refer to Tolin, McKay, Forman, Klonsky, & Thombs, 2015 published in Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice.) Using this framework, the Committee on Science and Practice has been tasked with “translat[ing] the research findings into clear recommendations of very strong, strong, or weak, using well-established, widely accepted, and transparent grading guidelines” (Tolin et al., 2015, pg. 332) that are developed from an evaluation of published systematic reviews of each treatment."
How is research support defined?,"There are many definitions of research support and many approaches one could take to characterize the level of research support for psychological treatments. This website relied on the criteria outlined by Chambless et al. (1998). These criteria require treatments to be efficacious in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or their logical equivalents. As in all health care, psychologists are dedicated to verifying the effects of their treatments on the targeted health problems. While many types of studies can help evaluate the benefits and safety of treatments, only RCTs and their logical equivalents afford strong causal inferences.
As stated above, we are in the process of re-evaluating the list of ESTs to fit with the Tolin et al. (2015) criteria."
What is “strong” and “modest” research support?,"Research support for a given treatment is labeled “strong” if criteria are met for what Chambless et al. (1998) termed “well-established” treatments. To meet this standard, well-designed studies conducted by independent investigators must converge to support a treatment’s efficacy. Research support is labeled “modest” if criteria are met for what Chambless et al. (1998) termed “probably efficacious treatments.” To meet this standard, one well-designed study or two or more adequately designed studies must support a treatment’s efficacy. In addition, it is possible for the “strong and “modest” thresholds to be met through a series of carefully controlled single-case studies. For a full description of the Chambless criteria readers are referred to Chambless et al. (1998). In addition, this site labels research support “controversial” if studies of a given treatment yield conflicting results or if a treatment is efficacious but claims about why the treatment works are at odds with the research evidence."
Do all psychologists agree on which treatments are supported by research?,No. There is healthy debate about what constitutes research support and which treatments can be considered to have sufficient research support. The references below provide important perspectives on these issues:
Is the method of treatment the only component that determines the effectiveness of treatment?,"No, certainly not. The client, the therapist, and the therapeutic relationship are among factors that also contribute to effective treatment. In providing information on research-supported psychological treatments we do not intend to devalue the importance of these other factors.
"
Are there other compilations of research-supported treatments for mental health and addictions?,"Yes. This website includes links to many of these resources.
"
Will this website be updated?,"Yes. In 2007, in her capacity as Division 12 President, Marsha Linehan asked the Committee on Science and Practice to develop an online version of the research-supported treatments list. The online format is meant both to facilitate dissemination and to be easily revised in response to new research findings. In 2008, the Division 12 board voted to indefinitely fund, maintain, and update the website."
Can I provide feedback or suggest a revision to the website?,"Yes. The literature on psychological treatments is vast and new findings are constantly emerging. Therefore, we plan to update the website frequently. We view feedback from clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals as an important source of information to guide updates. If you have a suggestion, please provide feedback to the website editor via email."
1. Do I have to apply for the RPT credential before I can apply for the RPT-S credential?,Yes. Applicants must hold the RPT credential for three consecutive years in good standing.
2. I am a current RPT(-S) and would like to obtain the SB-RPT as well. Does APT confer multiple credentials to an individual?,"No, registrants cannot hold more than one APT credential at any given time (so you are either an RPT or an RPT-S or an SB-RPT)."
3. Is it true that some states do not permit you to use the RPT acronym?,"Yes. Please review the list of states (at the bottom of page) that do not permit you to use the RPT acronym as it is already in use for registered physical therapists. In these states, registrants must spell out their credential."
4. What are the most recent changes made to the RPT/S program?,"· Effective January 1, 2020, APT revised the standards and application for the RPT credential, which includes a phase approach to the attainment of the RPT credentialing requirements. To learn more, please visit the RPT Standards and RPT Application."
5. What licenses meet the licensure requirement?,"Applicants must have a current, active, and unconditional clinical mental health license in the general practice fields of counseling, marriage and family therapy, psychiatry, psychology, or social work that permits for independent practice. The licensing board must be the government agency assigned to regulate and investigate the mental health profession regulated by an established mental health act. Membership to mental health associations does not meet the credentialing requirements for licensure. Please contact the office, should you continue to question whether or not your license/credential meets the RPT/S licensure requirement."
6. I’m an international applicant and the country where I practice does not issue formal licenses. Can I still be credentialed?,No. Applicants must meet the licensure requirement as defined in the Credentialing Standards. Membership to associations and graduate degree from universities alone do not meet APT’s requirements for licensure.
7. Are specialty licenses accepted?,"No. An add-on specialty license, for example addictions counselor, art therapist, or drama therapist, is not acceptable in lieu of a clinical mental health license in a general practice discipline of counseling, marriage and family therapy, psychiatry, psychology, or social work."
8. If I hold a disciplined license may I still apply?,"APT does not accept conditional licenses, irrespective of the conditions applied to the license. Once the license is returned to an unconditional status, it may meet APT’s licensure requirement."
9. Does the RPT or RPT-S credential replace my state mental health license?,"No. The RPT/S credentials are secondary credentials and do not legally permit you to practice without a state mental health license. In fact, applicants are not eligible for the RPT/S credentials without a clinical mental health license issued in the state in which they practice."
10. What are the basic educational requirements to become credentialed?,"Applicants must hold a graduate mental health degree in one of the following general practice disciplines: counseling, marriage and family therapy, psychiatry, psychology, or social work, with demonstrated coursework in the five (5) core content areas of child development, theories of personality, principles of psychotherapy, psychopathology/DSM, and legal/ethical issues."
11. I’m not sure my graduate program addressed the five (5) core content areas. Will APT review my academic transcripts before I submit my application?,"Yes. Simply complete and submit the Transcript Review request form with the fee and a copy of your transcripts to APT. For Advanced Standing social work applicants, please include a copy of your undergraduate transcripts with your graduate transcripts. If you are not interested in a transcript review but continue to have questions regarding the five (5) core content areas, please submit a copy of the syllabus for each course you believe satisfies the requirement with your completed application."
12. Are official transcripts required?,No. APT accepts copies of official transcripts or copies of unofficial transcripts as long as there is no question with the authenticity of the document(s).
13. Are graduate degrees in a specialty area accepted?,"No. APT accepts graduate clinical mental health degrees in the general practice discipline of counseling, marriage and family therapy, psychiatry, psychology, or social work. Graduate degrees in a specialty license, for example addictions counseling, art therapy, or drama therapy, are not acceptable in lieu of a clinical mental health degree in a general practice discipline as mentioned above."
14. How and from whom may I earn the 150 hours of play therapy instruction?,"You may complete graduate play therapy courses at institutions of higher education (transcripts) and/or workshops by APT Approved Providers of Play Therapy Continuing Education (certificates). Play therapy graduate courses must appear on a university transcript. If the term “play therapy” is not found on the course title, please submit a copy of the course syllabus and/or a letter from the instructor attesting to the hours of play therapy specific content offered in the course. For continuing education play therapy trainings, certificates must bear the APT Approved Provider number to be eligible for APT CE."
15. Am I required to take certain play therapy courses or trainings?,"While specific courses or trainings are not required, applicants must meet a minimum number of hours in four primary areas: play therapy history, seminal/historically significant theories, skills & methods in seminal/historically significant theories, and special topics (e.g. trauma, divorce, burgeoning play therapy models, etc.). Documentation must support the attainment of a well-rounded education in play therapy, which includes instruction in more than one play therapy approach. See Table 3.1 - Play Therapy Primary Areas of the Credentialing Standards for additional information. Please use your best clinical judgment to determine what primary areas your instructional hours fall under."
16. Am I permitted to use graduate play therapy courses I’ve taught or CE workshops I’ve presented towards the 150 hours of play therapy instruction?,No. Presentations and/or coursework taught or written by the applicant are not eligible.
17. What is considered contact training?,"· Contact hours earned starting January 1, 2020, are defined as in-person instruction only. Non-contact hours will consist of live webinars, recorded webinars, book studies, recorded audio programs, etc."
18. How many of the 150 hours of play therapy instruction may be non-contact or distance learning hours?,"No more than 50 of the 150 hours may be non-contact (e.g., APT E-Learning Center, pre-recorded webinars, etc.)."
19. Is there a time limit for achieving the 150 hours of play therapy instruction?,"Yes. Applicants must demonstrate attainment of the credentialing requirements in no less than two years and no more than seven years from start of accruement. The necessary skills to practice play therapy competently are not acquired in a short period of time – this includes training, supervision, and experience."
20. How many hours of play therapy experience (direct client contact hours) and observations are required?,"Hours earned starting January 1, 2020 must be under the supervision of an RPT-S with a minimum of 350 hours of direct client contact. Hours earned prior to January 1, 2020 may be under an RPT-S or a non-RPT-S with minimum hours of 335 and 500, respectively. Applicants are required to be observed in five (5) play therapy sessions by their supervisor."
21. How do I document my play therapy experience and supervision?,"· Hours earned starting 1/01/2020 are documented on the Criteria Verification forms (aka phase forms). Select the phase most consistent with where you are in the process (as informed by the hours earned compared to the required hours of the phases). Should you need assistance discerning this, APT is happy to help you."
22. Can I use internship or practicum hours from my graduate program towards the play therapy experience requirement?,"Yes. You may accrue such hours via your graduate play therapy practicums, internships, externships, etc. and must comply with the Phase approach."
23. Do I have to complete my play therapy training (instruction hours) before I can begin accruing my play therapy experience hours (direct client contact hours)?,Applicants must follow the phase approach outlined in the Credentialing Standards AND it is expected that applicants (and their supervisors) adhere to their respective Boards’ ethical guidelines and scope of practice. This likely means applicants may have taken some play therapy instruction prior to seeing clients.
24. How many supervision hours in play therapy must I complete?,"Hours earned starting January 1, 2020 must be under the supervision of an RPT-S with a minimum of 35 hours of play therapy supervision. Hours earned prior to January 1, 2020 may be under an RPT-S or a non-RPT-S with minimum hours of 35 and 50, respectively."
25. Where can I find an RPT-S to supervise me?,Use the Find a Registered Play Therapist Directory. Distance supervision is acceptable only if permitted by the supervisor’s/consultant’s and supervisee’s/consultee’s respective licensing boards.
26. Is there a limit to how many group supervision hours I can submit?,"Yes. For hours earned starting January 1, 2020, APT accepts no more than 10 hours of group supervision under an RPT-S. For hours earned prior to January 1, 2020, APT will accept no more than 20 hours of group supervision under a non-RPT-S or 15 hours under an RPT-S."
27. Are dyadic supervision sessions considered “individual” supervision?,"If the focus of the supervision was on your individual cases, then you may count only the time spent discussing your individual cases toward the “individual” supervision requirement."
28. Do I have to complete the play therapy instruction at the same time I complete my supervised experience and supervision?,"APT supports an integrative process of achieving the required play therapy instruction, clinical experience, and supervision in a manner that promotes cumulative learning and allows for the integration of education within clinical work. Applicants may be asked for additional information in the event their application does not demonstrate this type of integrated learning process."
29. Is there a time limit for achieving the credentialing requirements?,"Yes. Applicants must demonstrate attainment of the credentialing requirements in no less than two years and no more than seven years from start of accruement. The necessary skills to practice play therapy competently are not acquired in a short period of time – this includes training, supervision, and experience."
30. What if I did NOT complete my hours exactly following the phase approach?,"Applicants who began accruing their hours before the changes to the credentialing requirements were announced on May 31, 2019 will likely not meet the requirements as outlined in the Credentialing Application and Standards. However, applicants must demonstrate through their documentation an integrated and well-rounded attainment of the credentialing requirements. Applicants may provide a cover letter explaining any departure from the credentialing requirements to aid in APT’s determination of eligibility."
31. Is there any flexibility in the phase approach?,Yes. The flexibility of the phase approach lies in the demarcation of a) the date range and b) hours for each phase. Applicants may choose to shorten or lengthen the time period of any phase to best align play therapy trainings and/or the supervised play therapy experience/supervision with the requirements set forth in each phase.
32. Do I need to initial and sign the attestation section of the application?,Yes. The attestation is your expressed agreement to APT’s terms and conditions for holding our credentials. Leaving the attestation blank is considered an incomplete application and will delay the review process.
33. Do I have to participate in a news release?,No. It is optional and requires you to provide the contact information of the newspaper you wish notified.
34. When do I use Appendix I to document my completed requirements?,"Applicants must use Appendix I to document the play therapy instruction, experience, and supervision hours earned prior to January 1, 2020."
How is the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program accredited?,"The Clinical Mental Health Counseling program is accredited in clinical mental health counseling by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), which is a specialized accreditation agency in the United States. In addition to this specialized accreditation, Appalachian State University is accredited by Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, a regional accreditation agency."
What concentrations are offered to Clinical Mental Health Counseling majors?,"Students may elect specialized concentrations or pursue a general clinical mental health counseling program of study. Specialized concentrations include Addictions Counseling, Marriage and Family Counseling, Expressive Arts Therapy, and Body-Centered Therapy. In cases where motivated students have a unique interest of study, an individualized emphasis area may be developed under faculty support and guidance. You may inquire about this option by speaking to your faculty advisor upon admission to the program about the guidelines of creating an individualized emphasis."
What is the theoretical orientation of the program?,"The Clinical Mental Health Counseling program does not subscribe to one overarching theoretical orientation. Our students are introduced to a variety of counseling theories and techniques throughout the course of their academic experience, giving them freedom to explore many different counseling theories and techniques. While in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program, each student is expected to begin developing a personal approach to counseling that is consistent with the student's personality, values, and beliefs."
What are the professional and research interests of the Clinical Mental Health Counseling faculty?,Each faculty member in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program has both teaching and clinical experience. Current and prospective students can learn more about each faculty member by visiting the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Faculty page for the most up to date professional and research interests of each faculty member.
Can I apply for spring admission?,"No. Clinical Mental Health Counseling students are only accepted for Fall entry. Students are allowed to take courses in the summer before the fall that they are entering the program. There are no exceptions to this policy.
Do I have to have an undergraduate degree in psychology or counseling to apply?"
What is the minimum GRE score accepted by the program?,"The GRE is looked at as only one indicator of a student's academic ability and potential. When considering an application, the department looks at the student's academic history and successes, special achievements or honors, letters of recommendation, responses on the HPC special admissions questionnaire, professional and volunteer experiences and any other relevant information provided during the application process."
What strengths are you looking for in prospective applicants?,"The Admissions Committee carefully considers all of the documentation submitted as part of the student's application package: G.R.E. scores, previous G.P.A. and academic history, letters of recommendation, and the information provided by the student in the special admissions questionnaire.
Because some students are selected to interview as part of the admissions process, the special admissions questionnaire is also a crucial component of the student's application package. The Clinical Mental Health Counseling program looks for students who have a demonstrated commitment to personal growth, professional development, community involvement, and respecting both diversity and multiculturism."
"This all looks so exciting, but I have to support a family while I study. Do you accept part-time students?",Absolutely! Part-time students are welcomed into the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program.
How long does it take to complete the 60 credit M.A. Clinical Mental Health Counseling program?,Full-time students complete the program between 2 and 3 years. A graduate student is considered full-time at 9 credit hours and graduate students with an assistantship are generally allowed to take a maximum of 12 credit hours per semester. There is an opportunity to take summer courses to help a student progress along a two or three year time line.
What is the difference between a program concentration and a graduate certificate?,"A program concentration is available to Clinical Mental Health Counseling students as part of their 60 credit degree program. A concentration is generally composed of 9 academic credits of coursework. The concentrations available to Clinical Mental Health Counseling students include Addictions Counseling, Marriage and Family Counseling, Expressive Arts Therapy, and Body-Centered Therapy.
In addition to several concentrations, the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program also offers two graduate certificates for students to pursue: Expressive Arts Therapy (18 hrs) and Addictions Counseling (12 hrs). The Expressive Arts Therapy graduate certificate is a post master's experience, but students enrolled in HPC have the unique opportunity of simultaneously earning credit for both their master's program and the post-master's graduate certificate."
Are comprehensive examinations required in the M.A. Clinical Mental Health Counseling program?,"Yes, all students are required to take comprehensive exams as a graduation requirement. Students typically register for comprehensive exams during their last year of study. Some students prefer to take comprehensive exams during their 2nd to last anticipated semester and others elect to take comprehensive exams during their last semester or study. The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Exam (CPCE) is required prior to graduation."
Do I have to write a thesis? Can I write a thesis?,"Clinical Mental Health Counseling students are not required to write a thesis as part of their degree program, although it is an option supported by the department, especially intended for students who plan to pursue doctoral studies. A student planning to write a thesis will want to discuss this option early with his or her advisor to plan the program of study accordingly, to plan the research endeavor, and to put together a committee. Students with a strong desire to pursue a thesis are advised to locate a faculty member who has demonstrated interest in an area of practice similar to that of which the student hopes to examine during the research process. Students who write a thesis are still required to complete comprehensive examinations and a clinical internship as parts of their program of study.
Credentialing"
Will I be a National Certified Counselor (NCC) upon graduation?,"Students are not guaranteed credentialing as a NCC upon graduation. However, because our Clinical Mental Health Counseling program is CACREP accredited in community counseling, students are eligible to apply for the National Counselor Exam (NCE) while pursuing their program of study by applying through the Graduate Student Application (GSA) process outlined by their GSA-NCC campus coordinator. Students who pass the NCE while a student of a CACREP counseling program are granted the NCC credentials upon graduation. This is significant benefit of graduating from a CACREP accredited program such as ours. Typically, the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC) requires 3000 hours of post-degree supervision spanning a 2 yr period before an individual is eligible to apply for certification. However, our students will have this requirement waived and will become an NCC immediately upon graduation if they apply for certification and successfully pass the exam before graduation."
Am I eligible for state licensure upon graduation from ASU's Clinical Mental Health Counseling Program?,"The curriculum of the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program has been designed to aid graduates in meeting the academic coursework requirements outlined by the North Carolina Board of Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors (NCBLCMHC).
The state of North Carolina also requires applicants to pass the National Counselor Exam (NCE) and to have 3000 hours of supervised post-graduate counseling experience over a course of two years to apply for licensure. Graduates of our Clinical Mental Health Counseling program will be provided the opportunity to sit for the NCE prior to graduation."
How do I become a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor in North Carolina?,"The applicant must complete the application and submit the application processing fee, three letters of reference, official transcripts, and a professional disclosure statement. For more information, please visit the NCBLCMHC website."
How do I become licensed if I want to move to another state after graduation?,"The Clinical Mental Health Counseling program does not guarantee eligibility for licensure. With careful planning, it is possible for a student to design his/her program of study to meet the licensure requirements of most states. It is the student's responsibility to contact the state licensure board of the state the student wishes to move to upon graduation to determine these requirements.
The Clinical Mental Health Counseling program is a 60 credit M.A. program and most states require between 48-60 credits in a graduate counseling degree program as part of the licensure requirements. Some states require courses that are not part of our core Clinical Mental Health Counseling curriculum (i.e. human sexuality, addictions, counseling families and couples). This varies widely state to state. Fortunately, these courses are sometimes available to our students as electives."
Do you take insurance?,"Like many experienced therapists, I do not belong to managed care panels and resigned from them because of numerous concerns about privacy and quality of care. When I did belong, the panels often pressured me to provide too many personal details of my clients’ lives and to end treatment prematurely. I want our work to be private and the confidentiality of managed care treatment plans and insurance records cannot be guaranteed. I want us to decide when to end our work, not a for-profit corporation. I resigned from my last panel when an insurance company wanted to come to my office and review my client’s file, including the therapy notes.
I can give you a receipt for out of network reimbursement if you need one. Be aware that it will include a psychiatric diagnosis since health insurance is only for medical treatment. A diagnosis may affect future eligibility for life or disability insurance. If you cannot afford treatment without insurance, then you must balance the costs and the benefits for your particular situation"
How does a psychologist differ from other therapists?,"A clinical psychologist has had specialized training in graduate school for approximately 8 years and earned a PhD as well as completed a one year internship in a mental health setting. Psychologists are a select group with rigorous training requirements, including having done original research and using evidence-based techniques. We have the most stringent ethics code of the mental health professions and are not allowed to ask for testimonials or endorsements nor to make any guarantees of future outcomes for our clients. These rules are meant to protect your confidentiality and talk about realistic outcomes."
How can I protect myself as a consumer?,"Be sure that you only work with professionals who are licensed. Ask specifically which of the state licensing boards oversees their profession and when they obtained a license. A CERTIFICATE means nothing, as do any other terms that are used as substitute words for the word license. You may decide you want to call the state board and see if any complaints have been filed against that person."
What kind of counseling do you do?,"As a psychologist I have been trained in a wide variety of techniques and will use my experience to fit my approach to your needs. I have used techniques from experiential, humanistic, analytic, behavioral,cognitive, and family systems theories. In my work as a financial psychologist, I use techniques from the fields of behavioral finance, family business consulting and communication theory. Be sure and let me know what has and has not been helpful to you in the past if you have already consulted a professional."
What is financial psychology?,"This is a relatively new area of practice for psychologists and is based on the field of behavioral economics as well as incorporating clinical theories and observations. How clients make money decisions, their family history and their thoughts, feelings and behaviors related to money are areas that are covered by financial psychology. Consulting with and training financial advisers is also part of my work in this area."
What can a psychologist help with?,"Psychologists have studied human behavior and the brain (including how people think, feel, learn and behave) and have been trained to assist people who are having challenges coping with emotions, thoughts and actions. This can include those experiencing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, addictive behaviours and childhood behaviour disorders. Psychologists use evidence-based approaches that are tailored to suit each client and circumstance and they assess, diagnose and treat a wide range of clients and areas of concern.
Learn more about whether you should see a psychologist."
What’s the difference between a psychologist and a counsellor or therapist?,"Psychologists provide counselling and therapy to clients, but not all counsellors or therapists are Clinical and Registered Psychologists. In Australia, practicing psychologists are legally required to be registered with the national registration board, the Psychology Board of Australia and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. The term ‘counsellor’ is not protected in Australia, so anyone can use this title.
Clinical and Registered Psychologists must have a minimum of six years of university training and supervised experience and take part in ongoing education to keep their skills and knowledge up to date. Seeing someone who is registered ensures you receive high quality ethical treatment from a competent practitioner who follows a strict Code of Conduct. All of Direction Psychology’s practitioners are Clinical and Registered Psychologists."
What is the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?,"Psychologists are university trained and registered practitioners who assist people with challenges they are facing in their life including depression, anxiety, stress and relationship difficulties, as well as mental health issues. Their focus is on tailoring plans to help their clients develop skills and techniques to cope with difficulties and to prevent on-going issues and they often use a combination of therapies appropriate to the situation.
Psychiatrists are specialist medical doctors who have obtained additional qualifications to practice in the specialty of psychiatry. They specialise in the diagnosis and medical treatment of mental illness and can prescribe medication as well as using other therapies."
Do I need a referral to see a psychologist?,"No – you can make an appointment with our psychologists without a referral from your GP or a psychiatrist. If you have private health insurance that includes psychological counselling as extras cover, you may be eligible for a partial rebate on the cost of your appointment."
Are any costs covered under Medicare?,"If you have a referral for a Mental Health Treatment Plan from your GP or Psychiatrist, you will be eligible to receive a Medicare rebate of $86.15 per session with a Registered Psychologist, or $126.50 per session with a Clinical Psychologist for up to 10 sessions of individual counselling per calendar year."
How do I book?,"Whether you have a referral or not, simply request an appointment online or call us on 1300 322 068 and our team will be happy to assist you."
What should I expect at my first appointment?,"It’s very normal to feel anxious, nervous, or unsure about your first session of psychological counselling. Our psychologists will provide a private, comfortable, safe, respectful and non-judgmental place for you to discuss anything you need to.
In the first few sessions, the psychologist will typically ask you questions about yourself, your life, and any presenting problems you would like to work on. Together, you will create a plan of how therapy can assist you with these problems, how many sessions it may take, and how frequently you should meet. Prior to your first session it can be helpful for you to ask yourself what changes you would like to make in your life. The aim of therapy is for us to then work together to help you achieve those changes."
My child needs a psychologist – can I come with them?,"In the first session with your child, your psychologist will often invite you both into the session at the beginning, then ask to see the child by themselves. After this, your psychologist will discuss with you the most appropriate structure of future counselling sessions with your child.
In the case of adolescents, depending on the age of your teenager they may wish to see their psychologist without their parent present. However, it is recommended that a parent is always available to attend the sessions if needed, and parental consent is needed for under 16s to attend therapy."
How long do I need?,"Each individual therapy session is 50 minutes in length. How many sessions you need depends on your situation and can be discussed with your psychologist.
